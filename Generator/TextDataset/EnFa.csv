6954925,eng,I'm a peanut butter vacuum.
9388271,eng,Yanni reached a paved road.
2606799,eng,Ricardo got US$ 500 for winning.
6656644,eng,Tom is one of the best French teachers I know.
5853784,eng,Tom dangled his feet in the water.
45035,eng,Visitors to that town increase in number year by year.
10776560,eng,Tom has always done this.
2724256,eng,I'm in the post office.
5824828,eng,I'm willing to do that.
6357045,eng,Tom and Mary went bowling together.
8793116,eng,Yanni and Nuja perked up when they heard Skura's voice.
3620299,eng,Tom has been accused of murdering Mary.
6272612,eng,Tom seems awfully tired.
3449026,eng,Tom led us into a trap.
6423731,eng,Mary wasn't able to defend herself.
7514432,eng,Tom didn't know I didn't want to do that.
7382496,eng,He'll have to do it all by himself.
298112,eng,He grunted his agreement without looking at me.
10633973,eng,Please help me get the mouse.
6356960,eng,Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't win.
6650779,eng,Tom said that he'd like to help.
244920,eng,The cherry blossoms were at their best.
5840435,eng,I like it hot.
8597241,eng,There is no towel rack in that bathroom.
3821334,eng,I have a reputation to protect.
7543754,eng,Tom always wears a suit to work.
6272296,eng,Tom didn't let Mary pay the bill.
7436608,eng,Tom and Mary said that they plan to go on Monday.
1091938,eng,"Now it is true that I believe this country is following a dangerous trend when it permits too great a degree of centralization of governmental functions. I oppose this — in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose everything — even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution. This is what I mean by my constant insistence upon ""moderation"" in government."
7395106,eng,He didn't tell me where he'd been.
2203579,eng,I'm wealthy.
49270,eng,The song always reminds of my childhood.
9594585,eng,Yanni is learning Berber for fun.
10081824,eng,He has bought a new computer.
1901667,eng,How will I pay my debts?
2249805,eng,Please remember me.
5052161,eng,The train was very crowded.
7474470,eng,They say that they're not concerned.
7378882,eng,Mary never told me her last name.
7171779,eng,I thought you said that you were going to be on vacation.
3171308,eng,Tom is my age.
7228869,eng,I don't think Tom will be allowed to do that again.
8716903,eng,What floor are we on?
286241,eng,His ideas are difficult to understand.
2942708,eng,Are you shitting me?
8493379,eng,What happens when Popeye eats spinach?
1435894,eng,"As incredible as it may seem, she ordered a knuckle of ham with sauerkraut."
7202156,eng,Sami was waiting for Layla to come back.
5961560,eng,She had heart surgery.
275539,eng,A big tree fell in the storm.
9629511,eng,Some things don't need to change.
6232632,eng,Tom said that just doing that wouldn't be good enough.
6352989,eng,I'll come over this evening.
1120798,eng,I am food.
6246032,eng,I think Tom could be back tomorrow.
3439591,eng,"As you can see, Tom is pretty good at it."
243587,eng,Would you like sugar and milk?
8788802,eng,He has promised not to do that any more.
7271293,eng,Sami's dog wasn't moving.
9167245,eng,Sweat runs down his chest.
3820617,eng,I didn't know where to start.
6505335,eng,Tom and Mary said that they'd been forced to do that.
6230064,eng,It would probably be depressing to do that by yourself.
1359494,eng,Nobody cares about that.
7728094,eng,He's going to build his own computer.
307332,eng,They saw him enter the room.
3177878,eng,Tom told me he sleeps with the window open.
25151,eng,I don't care what happens.
265170,eng,"To tell the truth, he wasn't up to the work."
8285449,eng,He who excuses himself accuses himself.
8385692,eng,I found that hard.
7226589,eng,I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
10351086,eng,You will certainly regret it!
3378691,eng,You have a very nice smile.
6654598,eng,Tom said that he didn't see anything.
6507756,eng,"Tom and Mary don't really want to do that, do they?"
3368899,eng,Free speech is still dangerous in some countries.
10096736,eng,"Yanni touched Skura on her knee, not her thigh."
456017,eng,Is it always so awful in April?
6927526,eng,"Tom is waiting with Mary, isn't he?"
10359587,eng,Is this even edible?
8693523,eng,She wanted to get divorced.
3205068,eng,"As Tom tried to tell you, you're not allowed in here."
6869026,eng,You should have told me you needed money.
2942933,eng,What's the minimum salary in Ukraine?
4878614,eng,I see the signs well.
6647595,eng,Tom thinks doing that may be a good idea.
9351993,eng,This accident happened in front of his very eyes.
1185314,eng,I told you you had to go home. Why are you still here?
245588,eng,My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
2641063,eng,We have lots of other things to drink.
7246980,eng,Sami really disappointed Layla.
6518163,eng,Tom and Mary helped themselves to coffee.
635618,eng,Dad is coming home tomorrow.
7762129,eng,The cranium contains the brain.
7787943,eng,You don't know what you're saying right now.
50792,eng,"And to make matters worse, he met with a traffic accident."
10214044,eng,Ziri is a refined Englishman.
35344,eng,There were no more than five passengers in the bus.
328951,eng,Be sure to simmer on a low heat so it doesn't boil.
1242863,eng,"You're not busy, right?"
7173699,eng,I thought that you knew Tom.
5852300,eng,What do you do all day?
2821059,eng,I should have paid more attention to the signs.
1880760,eng,Where did you peel them?
7829459,eng,"He was stationed in Kabylie, Algeria."
1655756,eng,Just ignore him.
287189,eng,His proposal counted for nothing.
3735267,eng,Tom should've been here thirty minutes ago.
6348771,eng,Tom never seems to smile anymore.
1961814,eng,I thought you'd be pleased.
6250868,eng,Will you really be able to do that?
7587493,eng,She was so close to me that I could have touched her.
6263252,eng,I didn't keep my appointment.
284213,eng,I wonder whether he'll make it here on time tomorrow. Want to bet a can of juice on it?
321181,eng,The busy bee has no time for sorrow.
6258558,eng,Tom didn't tell Mary he wanted to find another job.
8584247,eng,Tom sounds tired.
6532015,eng,Tom lost sight of Mary.
6691103,eng,Sami set his plan into action.
5806848,eng,I don't think they're bad people.
10672390,eng,Ground hornbills are entirely carnivorous.
302156,eng,He came about two.
8535547,eng,She grabbed the gun away from him before he could kill himself.
2866192,eng,"This and ""that"" are English demonstrative pronouns."
6577448,eng,Clear the field.
6531067,eng,Tom didn't need to apologize.
5794159,eng,There will be two workers for every retiree in the next 20 years.
3920362,eng,This is between them and me.
6434048,eng,Mary said she didn't want to let Tom drive.
5936768,eng,I'm very worried about what might happen.
8414866,eng,He woke up and found a horse's head in his bed.
10746940,eng,Would you like to study another language?
7241905,eng,Sami was a huge Egyptian dude.
1040565,eng,Tom said that he was too tired to do anything else.
3129787,eng,"If that happens, I'll resign."
7522297,eng,I know Tom is a lot smarter than Mary is.
6091241,eng,Aren't you prepared?
6664655,eng,We can manage this on our own.
8085768,eng,No one would do something like this in Kabylie.
6513125,eng,"Tom and Mary didn't need to do that, did they?"
1685980,eng,This is the boy who played with the toy that scared the frog that splashed the dog that chased the cat that ate the rat that killed the mouse that lived in the house that Jack built.
44226,eng,The people in the room all know one another.
30200,eng,He stuck to his opinion though I told him not to.
20513,eng,"As was expected, he succeeded in winning the prize."
5149968,eng,Tom didn't need it.
9179728,eng,This restaurant didn't meet my expectations.
8875583,eng,This tie goes well with your shirt.
6248074,eng,I guess Tom will have to do that.
290721,eng,He didn't give up the plan.
6711237,eng,Sami is a brave man.
2775442,eng,I bet she is younger than me.
283779,eng,It was fortunate that he was taken to a nearby hospital right away after the accident.
6869317,eng,Tom should have given Mary a birthday present.
8864049,eng,I wasn't the one who killed Tom's dog.
5852347,eng,How much can you make delivering pizzas?
7186024,eng,I'm sorry that I let you down.
7438136,eng,They said that they're cautiously optimistic.
9837818,eng,You're not lost.
2953937,eng,We're proud of you.
8405949,eng,Can I have both of these?
268468,eng,The castle lies to the east of the town.
8165853,eng,I want to know why you're not doing that anymore.
239539,eng,Everything is all right now.
2360395,eng,I have the tickets.
2018812,eng,I want to know exactly how Tom died.
2953806,eng,We urged Tom to go.
1811814,eng,I have nothing to add to that.
2014242,eng,Do you want to know why I quit?
246608,eng,My meeting her at the station was a pure accident.
8613296,eng,Tom had never really paid attention to Mary.
1919800,eng,"Honor! truly a very convenient coin, which those who know how to pass it may lay out with great advantage."
3172401,eng,Are you contented?
3361817,eng,You can ask the Court of Justice to undo an act.
8614228,eng,He was walking up the stairs.
8315228,eng,She's off-key.
10105349,eng,Algeria needs to develop its ready-made clothing sector.
8186074,eng,Tom had no idea Mary already had a boyfriend.
8385769,eng,Tom robbed me.
2240751,eng,We're nearly there.
7925175,eng,I saw.
5852810,eng,I'm a florist.
7407709,eng,They give their children allowances.
797159,eng,We had to lessen the impact of the erratic supplies.
9953838,eng,"I am Kabyle and I love Israel. ""Does anyone care about that? There are even Palestinians who love Israel."""
6884516,eng,"I'll apologize first, okay?"
7217388,eng,I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
9432462,eng,Do you also write music?
6206779,eng,It takes a great man to be a good listener.
7174735,eng,Tom thought Mary was having a good time.
10025173,eng,"Would English be phonetically consistent if we added accents on every word, each one always giving a consistent pronunciation?"
8517197,eng,He persuaded the store manager to give him back his money.
3915158,eng,I may have to help him.
9958586,eng,Yanni wants to fix his neck hump.
3824730,eng,It's probably my fault.
3517209,eng,"If you'd grow a beard, you'd look a lot like Tom."
1562158,eng,That's what I've always said.
2276341,eng,Tom didn't have any fun.
6241936,eng,I should've been able to do that for you.
328138,eng,I started to think I had behaved foolishly.
3906749,eng,Have you ever spoken to them?
9444236,eng,Access to electricity has improved in Algeria.
6484964,eng,Sami loves acoustic music.
10240850,eng,Ziri and Rima knew each other since high school or college.
6849240,eng,I've joked with Tom about that.
6235942,eng,Tom and I are getting ready to do that right now.
8462291,eng,My father planted this tree.
2239313,eng,I'm not happy about it.
8396112,eng,I don't watch that much television.
10685355,eng,I don't know anything about Tom's job.
40458,eng,Tell whoever comes that I'm out.
8009396,eng,Do you know who Tom's grandfather was?
637071,eng,"A curious German word is ""entfernen"" (to put some distance between), because the prefix ""ent-"" means to take something away, in this case the distance, but taking away the distance would mean to bring it closer which is the exact opposite of what the word ""entfernen"" means."
7796286,eng,They helped her go to Canada.
6247458,eng,Do you think Tom might be correct?
66053,eng,You must always tell the truth.
3436781,eng,Were you indiscreet?
7807929,eng,I wish you'd told me the truth then.
6261602,eng,Didn't I tell you I'd do that?
8523205,eng,You might meet him if you go to the library.
315689,eng,She has a drunken husband.
10205446,eng,"We come into this world alone, and that’s how we’ll leave it."
6244770,eng,I never expected to be able to do that.
10693860,eng,Katya turned a page in the magazine.
6518434,eng,Where were Tom and Mary last night?
8415877,eng,Tom probably won't even remember my name.
65597,eng,Won't you come over to my place?
6907372,eng,"Soon the disenfranchised, downtrodden laymen started a full out uprising, seeking to tear out the remnants of their oppression."
6337473,eng,I think I speak French better than Tom.
8528668,eng,"She's still your friend, isn't she?"
296636,eng,He is having lunch.
6426807,eng,Mary found herself alone again.
6648506,eng,Tom said that he thought Mary was tired.
2458592,eng,I think you're perfect.
3419305,eng,They stayed at a very expensive hotel.
7874748,eng,You seem to have an asthma.
4792121,eng,"A scientist will read dozens of books in his lifetime, but still believe he has a lot more to learn."
3434255,eng,Tom used his head.
4013618,eng,Why won't anybody answer my questions?
5672607,eng,"Everybody called Mary ""the Sphinx"", because she always spoke in riddles."
4368256,eng,It's your turn to speak.
69881,eng,Do you watch television?
7784824,eng,"“But other than that, they they’re nice,” he said. “They don’t treat me differently.”"
10337391,eng,The pain has gotten a lot worse.
9095816,eng,"Tom isn't still single, is he?"
6624751,eng,"Those indignant winds grumble with a loud murmuring around the confines of the mountain; Aeolus sits in his high citadel, holding his scepter, and he soothes their spirits and tempers their rages: if he did not do this, they would surely snatch away seas and lands and the deep heaven itself, and sweep them off through the windy sky."
6128786,eng,My mother works in a big office.
265242,eng,"In fact, the opposite is more likely to occur."
8566767,eng,Who gave him that money?
8225521,eng,Our ideas do not match.
6825803,eng,Tom married a ballet dancer.
329676,eng,"I spent three years looking for a good director, but couldn't find one."
8978106,eng,He had trouble pronouncing the sibilant letters.
10551466,eng,"Although I went to bed early, I couldn't get to sleep."
4496339,eng,That's the catch.
9720108,eng,I admit that I was hesitant to speak to you the first time I saw you.
3635810,eng,This place smells bad.
2396321,eng,"Sorry, I didn't hear you."
329590,eng,The downclimb here is also dangerous as there are no handholds.
5840515,eng,I can't paint.
6226977,eng,Tom told Mary that he didn't think John had finished doing that by 2:30.
6074186,eng,Many hospitals in England have been hit by a cyber-attack.
4668393,eng,What lovely legs!
6815057,eng,Do you plan to do that with Tom?
4664141,eng,"Tom didn't have to help, but he did."
243505,eng,I heard someone call my name in the crowded bus.
7511317,eng,Tom said he didn't want to say anything else.
764407,eng,Find multilingual sentence equivalents at Tatoeba.org.
6498171,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't think John knew how to drive.
9684439,eng,You're wrong in some respects.
3456702,eng,Leanne has tried to fix the computer.
7190585,eng,Sami did not trust Layla.
10459714,eng,Tom has become absent-minded.
303517,eng,He placed the ladder against the fence.
296037,eng,He tried in vain to open the locked door.
9483208,eng,Did you see anything new?
7474715,eng,They say they want to learn French.
6765628,eng,Tom needs to know that.
7194878,eng,Did Tom ask you to go to Australia with him?
3204946,eng,Tom told Mary his father died when he was thirteen.
5640408,eng,Tom had blisters on his hands.
8071484,eng,I wanted Tom to visit me.
7398439,eng,She says she's getting a divorce.
8999377,eng,The con artist was considered an honest person.
10579516,eng,The mission’s observations will help illuminate two of the biggest cosmic puzzles: dark energy and dark matter.
431048,eng,What's going on in this town?
7408889,eng,They admitted they were famished.
8584621,eng,Tom is unpacking.
4718993,eng,"I'd like some unsweetened tea, please."
6352949,eng,I don't think Tom knows what Mary thinks he should do.
2016580,eng,Do you want me to buy you a drink?
6072141,eng,Sami called Layla slut.
2737512,eng,We met in Xi'an.
6711351,eng,Sami flushed Layla's pictures down the toilet.
7189867,eng,I assumed that you'd wait.
6814328,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom will be on time.
7243409,eng,"Tom is 13, but he still believes in Santa."
7325869,eng,Sami loves the work that I'm doing.
283679,eng,"Whether he agrees or not, we won't change our plans."
9951988,eng,Yanni is not laughing.
6735849,eng,Tom tickled Mary.
3905960,eng,I can deliver that to her.
7752730,eng,"As Tom was about to reply, the door opened, and Mary rushed in."
7035934,eng,"For some reason, it made me happy."
7382579,eng,She wasn't quite herself today.
10596540,eng,Have you got a bike I could borrow?
2700975,eng,I would have been happier wearing a mask.
7137576,eng,Sami is coming over.
3622295,eng,"Child, why are you crying? Tell me."
6620610,eng,You’ve seen too many movies.
9758939,eng,Yanni doesn't want the house.
5380157,eng,He served me coffee.
6145761,eng,It's a crying shame that people don't want to see the problem.
8076753,eng,I'm not up to anything.
1691379,eng,I just got a good idea.
8965566,eng,This kind of partisan skulduggery has no place in a government agency.
4733479,eng,"I read many foreign languages, but I don't speak any."
8181799,eng,Could you give me a piece of paper?
9440619,eng,I'm not sure when he'll be back.
1744831,eng,Mohand is my half brother.
8385752,eng,Tom and Mary were arguing.
7170130,eng,I think that Tom will do great.
5011123,eng,"A Russian told me ""It's hard to understand the Russian soul."""
6582590,eng,Do you have the map?
5736419,eng,There must be a fire nearby.
7510461,eng,Tom told everyone he wanted to move to Boston.
6500209,eng,Tom and Mary assured me that they wouldn't do that again.
6602126,eng,Are there still wolves around here?
8536645,eng,She built the house herself along with the help of a few friends.
4502572,eng,They're terrified of you.
7230384,eng,I don't think Tom knows that he shouldn't be doing that.
6677592,eng,The bells have rung.
7731898,eng,Tom is only three months older than I am.
8998948,eng,We have to take care of that today.
9668799,eng,"Last Monday, I stayed at home and read a book."
10309149,eng,"Ah, its snow!"
6661894,eng,You don't need to give me anything.
287973,eng,It made him uneasy that someone might find out any second what he was hiding.

1029051,eng,Tom doesn't love Mary anymore.
6508576,eng,This is the hospital where Tom and Mary work.

1898064,eng,This time we won.
274070,eng,"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."
6216608,eng,Sorry for bombarding you with so many questions.
8541548,eng,The cops arrived almost an hour later.

6780535,eng,Tom won't find us.
3204401,eng,Please don't tell Tom what I just told you.
254309,eng,I feel nervous about the result.
7127692,eng,Tom walked briskly down the road.
6898649,eng,"Tom is lying, isn't he?"
8195593,eng,Tom wasn't sure if he was dreaming.
1389907,eng,Are you fucking stupid?
664086,eng,A debtor of my debtor is not a debtor of mine.
7237969,eng,Sami ran to the truck.
2952457,eng,I think I know everything I need to know about this.
1665663,eng,I am meowing like a cat.
6500159,eng,Tom and Mary didn't do that as quickly as they should've.
9053775,eng,I know a simpler way to do it.
7397273,eng,She said she's feeling better now.
6335291,eng,Tom might be through eating by now.
7168708,eng,I think that Tom is interested in doing that.
8803378,eng,Yanni is just in front of us.
3619267,eng,Let me put a fresh bandage on your arm.
1177512,eng,Tom has been busy.
8994378,eng,He deleted his rant because he was worried about being doxxed.
8911031,eng,It happened to Tom.
1112606,eng,"We didn't know how to do it, so we asked for help."
6493149,eng,Tom and Mary wanted John to know that they really didn't want to do that.
7132075,eng,Tom and Mary are available.
4275666,eng,I worry about my future.

9833758,eng,Three Canadians died in the attack.
5839423,eng,"Fadil's twin sister, Dania, has never known a life without him."
2203211,eng,Tom is powerless.
9848965,eng,Have you ever had an occasion to sing in public?
7508289,eng,Tom won't likely find anybody to do that for him.
300415,eng,"He told the truth, otherwise he would have been punished."
6265486,eng,Tom said that Mary has to be more careful.
7386137,eng,He slammed the door on his way out.
7474604,eng,They expressed their disappointment.
6255878,eng,Doing that would probably be fun.
10151933,eng,We didn't wait for our turn.
9701638,eng,"We're all out of grog, Captain."
6253180,eng,I thought I must be seeing things.
8750621,eng,"In all my years as a priest, I have not witnessed a single miracle."
10604993,eng,Did you stay at home on your own?
4017045,eng,What do you suppose this could be?
265319,eng,When one lucky spirit abandons you another picks you up. I just passed an exam for a job.
5736422,eng,There have been no setbacks.
8397457,eng,Tom wasn't the one who blew the balloons up.
3906098,eng,Would you talk to them?
6085142,eng,"Are you a camera? Because every time I look at you, I smile."
54658,eng,Let's stop this fruitless discussion.
6356382,eng,I drink beer every day.
7230276,eng,I don't think that Tom has any idea what Mary has to do tomorrow.
1740930,eng,My parents don't know.

63803,eng,Carl showed me the gold medal.
1234981,eng,I'd rather die than lose my life!
3151541,eng,Give me a little space.
7196967,eng,I can't believe that you didn't have to do that.
1256701,eng,"Now, said Mr. Wood."
7987495,eng,Sami is a problem.
6494741,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought they'd be able to get home by 2:30.

6807370,eng,Sami sent Layla a very poetic text message.
8526725,eng,"She's an expert, isn't she?"
6993579,eng,"The South Korean boy band on Monday reached the number-one position on the Billboard Top 200 music list, with the album “Love Yourself: Tear.”"

10136222,eng,I think that house is a little too small for your family.
265728,eng,"As a young man, he did not know that he was to become famous later on."
9688495,eng,Tom is too sick to go to school today.
8076746,eng,I haven't changed. You have.
806919,eng,Many of them carried guns.
3737694,eng,Why are you tired?
3002009,eng,It sounds to me like you're interested.
10637925,eng,I won't be at home tomorrow evening.
4834912,eng,You should look into that.
2642221,eng,"Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?"
3360631,eng,Tom was intrigued.
9198227,eng,I think this isn't mine.
10123659,eng,I'm considering how to settle the matter.
7517130,eng,I know that Tom isn't a messy person.
3726982,eng,I do pray sometimes.
6338213,eng,I don't think Tom knows very much about Australia.
4015342,eng,Tom ate the salad that Mary made for him.
3200007,eng,Tom told me what he saw.
3424267,eng,Tom never was dependable.
8476618,eng,He's baffled.
6071370,eng,I didn't want to do what Tom asked me to do.
8341516,eng,Tom shot the tiger.
6289419,eng,"Creative people tend to ask the best questions, and therefore they get the best answers."
1799015,eng,Did I forget to write the date?
6352982,eng,Tom wasn't the one who told me about Mary's accident.
9248140,eng,I was busy mashing some potatoes.
4064819,eng,You should have let me warn you when I had the chance.
6340367,eng,I need to get back to Boston as soon as possible.
2645525,eng,Have they said anything?
6382877,eng,I can't even swallow.
2026624,eng,What did Tom want to talk to Mary about?
6663935,eng,We agree with Tom.
6358536,eng,Tom made me wait.
9847418,eng,We weren't able to close the deal.
8994582,eng,We're tired and hungry.
5916438,eng,You should do what Tom is doing.
6264363,eng,I think Tom could teach Mary how to do that.
5257478,eng,This child internalizes his emotions and does not express them.
7732384,eng,Tom is in the middle of a divorce.
7385685,eng,She now lives with her mom.
6343094,eng,Tom really wants to go water skiing again.
2546601,eng,I'm going to need help.
3911802,eng,No one noticed him.
6849017,eng,Let's buy this car.
6272482,eng,Tom told Mary he was doing that.
2891091,eng,Do you know Tom's girlfriend's name?
9203749,eng,There are some people that I just can't stand.
3904880,eng,Don't you want to visit her?
8116743,eng,I just remembered a joke.
6255939,eng,Tom says he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that.
6113235,eng,I suggest that you do that right away.
6531196,eng,Tom isn't going out tonight.
2412314,eng,Tom and Mary were about to leave when John arrived.
6925159,eng,I like apricots.
4499838,eng,Tom invited me inside.
6769628,eng,"You're Canadians, aren't you?"
258365,eng,I accounted for the failure.
7513592,eng,Tom really thought Mary needed to do that.
1137280,eng,Don't give a child more money than is necessary.
7299590,eng,Sami is gonna drop Layla off at home.
7136782,eng,I think that all of us want to know what happened.
7172801,eng,"I thought that Tom was finished, but he told me that he wasn't."
5733438,eng,What regulations would apply?
5860036,eng,How intolerable people are sometimes who are happy and successful in everything.
5817644,eng,Look at all the damage you've done.
8041918,eng,You're gonna do the whole thing.
2881846,eng,Can we get closer?
1522478,eng,Tom is in the clubhouse.
59674,eng,This church dates from the 12th century.
313166,eng,She is careful about the way she receives guests.
6048931,eng,"Hey, can you lend a hand here?"
6234476,eng,Why don't you let Tom know that you'll do that?
4877403,eng,Can leopards run as fast as cheetahs?
2542860,eng,They're all wearing name tags.
2301838,eng,It's not for everyone.
6492025,eng,I don't know if Tom and Mary are home today.
6259195,eng,I don't have to move to Boston.
7232325,eng,I don't think that Tom knows when Mary came to Boston.
256005,eng,I was compelled to do this against my will.
7930422,eng,Why is grass green?
10753214,eng,Rima and Skura don't go to school on Saturday.
5011335,eng,Bunnies are social animals.
2523825,eng,Mr. John's older than I thought.
710982,eng,Incest is a taboo found in almost all cultures.
794970,eng,He's a Parisian.
239944,eng,I looked in the cupboard.
3910156,eng,I thought you came to see her.
1432372,eng,There's no way I'll continue this conversation.
8186044,eng,Is it true Tom wants to live in Boston?
7759639,eng,He backed into a car in the parking lot.
7170574,eng,I knew that Tom wouldn't come back.
263381,eng,I have good eyesight.
3199829,eng,Tell Tom about it.
57246,eng,"At this rate, we'll have to change the schedule."
8478722,eng,He's very slow.
10122065,eng,Stop clowning around.
2098946,eng,"Excuse me, could someone tell me where the bathroom is?"
6178878,eng,Who are you coming with?
44037,eng,The report revealed that many teenagers are alcoholics.
5741245,eng,I think it's coming along.
953775,eng,I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.
1840396,eng,Send me the text you want to translate.
3738611,eng,Did you buy anything to eat?
8514814,eng,She risked her own life to help him.
4666823,eng,I don't cook every day.
9806980,eng,Yanni didn't keep his promise to put Skura on his life insurance.
5528579,eng,It's so dark in Sweden in the winter.
8038316,eng,"And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel: They are straitened in the land, the desert hath shut them in."
6349198,eng,Why were you eating by yourself?
7928180,eng,He is bored.
7222780,eng,There's a chance that Tom will be there.
4350777,eng,I gave each child three pieces of candy.
2658197,eng,The second book has more errors than the first.
6253038,eng,Tom said the earthquake woke him up.
10226656,eng,Ziri didn't believe Rima for a second.
9824345,eng,Yanni seems to like it.
7520698,eng,Tom was born before Mary was.
7520078,eng,Tom didn't know Mary loved him.
7389532,eng,He thought he was losing his mind.
5913224,eng,Sami didn't seem very busy today.
2196362,eng,Do you happen to have matches?
6524328,eng,I wonder whether Tom has seen this movie or not.
1028484,eng,Tom is three years ahead of Mary at school.
6424675,eng,"Mary said she was having fun, too."
5555002,eng,How dare you call me a criminal?
7476800,eng,They lost their houses.
6067406,eng,Layla and Sami met at a shopping mall.
10550272,eng,When was the last time someone asked you for your advice?
10661488,eng,She didn't shed a single tear for him.
5838975,eng,Layla has probably run off again.
5109604,eng,Tom chatted with Mary.
10503058,eng,Keep in mind that Tom can't understand French.
2641005,eng,Tom and Mary are just average students.
8856914,eng,Isn't there reception here?
5363958,eng,The predictive power of this theory has been demonstrated time and time again.
8398731,eng,I won't buy Tom that.
1898046,eng,We might as well go ahead and do that now.
10493103,eng,Looks as if she's going to win an award.
2538865,eng,Tom asked Mary how long she could wait.
9131451,eng,What I hate is looking for work.
4135205,eng,What games do you have on your phone?
3312156,eng,We'll try this later.
850902,eng,By that time I'll have already left.
6226671,eng,Tom said that isn't the main reason Mary wants to do that.
697951,eng,The kernel of a group homomorphism always contains the neutral element.
8883846,eng,She walked by without noticing me.
9935258,eng,She does not have enemies.
7294355,eng,Sami and Layla talked about this before.
9999544,eng,We need to contact Tom.
308514,eng,She was seen to run up the stairs with tears in her eyes.
4902872,eng,It was kind of unexpected.
4455392,eng,"The King's English is not the King's. It's a joint stock company, and Americans own most of the shares."
7276678,eng,Sami started getting really close to Layla.
7010760,eng,Tom isn't likely to get into Harvard.
4629812,eng,Tom considered Mary a piece of garbage.
2953596,eng,We could go there now.
6266549,eng,Tom is usually free on Monday.
1363387,eng,Don't be so perverse!
6257119,eng,Tom did that the old fashioned way.
9145845,eng,Tom had the house all to himself.
9287173,eng,We landed the helicopter.
6495844,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they didn't think Alice was boring.
9995615,eng,Yanni was in that corner.
316307,eng,She gave him a watch.
8384135,eng,I got a text message in French.
70249,eng,Are you going to go to Tokyo tomorrow?
266966,eng,Haruki and Machiko were very happy to see each other again.
6248667,eng,I didn't have a good time doing that.
3579630,eng,The Spanish team is great at keeping possession of the ball.
3422152,eng,You know as well as I do that we can't afford to buy that kind of car.
780842,eng,He complimented me.
5674571,eng,I had problems with my former tenants.
8682912,eng,They replaced Clay's voice actor with some guy who has a gravelly voice.
6228541,eng,I pretended that I didn't know that Tom had stolen my computer.
7538143,eng,Tom gets a generous salary.
6110305,eng,I don't know who can do that.
5409462,eng,Will you make it in time?
324818,eng,The suspect told a lie to the inspector.
298396,eng,He writes to me once in a while.
5486640,eng,"A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both."
3202421,eng,"If you know where Tom lives, tell me."
3738764,eng,Why would that be considered sexist?
8034061,eng,Berber class is on Friday.
6325792,eng,The Internet is a meeting point for people with common interests.
61446,eng,Don't pour hot water into the glass or it will crack.
6244637,eng,Tom ate a couple of sandwiches for lunch.
6254251,eng,Tom said Mary knew John might not need to do that this year.
7540578,eng,Tom and Mary worked together for three months.
2648914,eng,Tom was at home.
6235095,eng,Tom has been living in Boston for three years now.

8904669,eng,Per capita income is about two-thirds that of the US mainland.
6157627,eng,Perhaps all the dragons of our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us once beautiful and brave.
276238,eng,Who do you think will win the tournament?
1544565,eng,My anti-virus let a virus through.
9828967,eng,That needs to be investigated.
3922928,eng,Tom will be along soon.
3333930,eng,"Here, try it on."
9460603,eng,It's about time we started.
320673,eng,Mother cut the cheese with a knife.
8535515,eng,She said he was planning to do that by himself.
69020,eng,You should not laugh at his mistake.
6510946,eng,Tom and Mary don't think they'll be able to win.
6527931,eng,Tom doesn't like Mary calling him at work.
2026918,eng,I want to go over these numbers with you.
46237,eng,The boss has a high opinion of his secretary.
6236902,eng,It's clear that Tom doesn't like doing that.
953970,eng,"In retrospect, I should have known that it was a scam."
8575649,eng,Do you know who helped Tom?
66618,eng,In Britain they call the subway the underground.
2549006,eng,Tom had one child.
30941,eng,Would you mind terribly making me a cup of coffee?
6874143,eng,"We're good friends now, but we didn't like each other at first."
6505004,eng,I don't want to help Tom and Mary do that anymore.
2996269,eng,Nobody saw anything.
5735018,eng,The desk was covered with dust.
9237970,eng,A cold front is heading our way from Iceland.
2520301,eng,The T-shirt costs ten euro.
299875,eng,He engages himself in every new project.
10772007,eng,Keep your big nose out of our family business.
3150016,eng,The boy repeats everything we say like a parrot.
5006897,eng,"You hate horror movies, don't you?"
1331873,eng,Several sentences make no sense. So what?
7511055,eng,I knew Tom didn't know that you had done that.
9921690,eng,Don't talk to her right now.
3724496,eng,I'm here looking for work.
8015850,eng,Do you mind helping me with my Arabic lesson?
6228029,eng,I know that Tom is obstinate.
3738121,eng,Aren't you feeling well?
260944,eng,I trust him because he never tells a lie.
6513287,eng,Tom and Mary are afraid that they'll get lost.
6514347,eng,At least we know Tom and Mary are alive.
6662006,eng,Tom sells postcards to tourists.

5680612,eng,The President posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor to two World War I soldiers.

259956,eng,I object to his making private calls on this phone.
6351005,eng,Is Tom also a teacher?
9249061,eng,Learning English is easier than you think it is.
7211825,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was divorced.
6694092,eng,Sami needed to borrow six thousand dollars.
5130912,eng,He has good vibes.

8401053,eng,He's on the porch.
2540703,eng,I don't have a girlfriend anymore.

8725722,eng,Nobody told me about you waiting for me.

6423178,eng,Mary said she's seen Tom doing that.
6676812,eng,Tom often loses his keys.
6659966,eng,I'm going to do what you tell me to do.
3151336,eng,Let me give you some cash.

324715,eng,I need an extra pillow.
8271410,eng,That will depend exclusively on you.
263220,eng,We must allow for his poor health.
3181821,eng,I think we'd better talk to Tom.
7987632,eng,Sami met a lot of actresses and actors.
3086090,eng,He's a huge fan of trains.
7241447,eng,Sami will understand why I don't like this guy.
67152,eng,One day she and I visited an old friend.
7974709,eng,Nobody cares what you do.
66902,eng,That politician put his foot in his mouth when he made those racist comments.
1530941,eng,"Tom drives a black car, right?"
7932256,eng,I drink water.
6890585,eng,I like salmon.
261454,eng,I couldn't go to work because I was sick.
4666121,eng,Tom is allowed to do that.
5277646,eng,"It disgusts me, too."
2133052,eng,On the beach you can spend time with your friends.
2582561,eng,Leave now so you're not tardy.
7493507,eng,Tom probably doesn't know he isn't likely to be fired.
2241108,eng,We have food.
8595209,eng,Benedict is Jacob's husband.
6494457,eng,Tom and Mary said they understand why John may not want to do that.
7214491,eng,Tom told me that he didn't have much time.
6357575,eng,Tom told Mary John wouldn't win.
9260315,eng,The rifle was loaded.
1211553,eng,I can't afford that.
1773389,eng,"People keep saying that he's beautiful, but really, he isn't."
7382506,eng,He'll do that himself.
9684481,eng,Come here. Let me take a look.
3568104,eng,What makes you think I'm going to help you?
10357906,eng,Mary bought a semi-derelict house for a pound.
3921434,eng,We should probably tell Tom.
6110416,eng,Tom won't help you do that.
5095223,eng,Let them go.
9972380,eng,I didn't know that Mary was Tom's girlfriend.
7475466,eng,They gave it everything they had.
6249624,eng,Tom finds fault with everything I say.
8532016,eng,He spoke about the problem with her.
7175811,eng,Tom thinks that Mary will be doing that with John and him.
9354865,eng,I'm pretty sure that somebody was tailing me.
6252311,eng,Tom complained that his stomach hurt.
2733186,eng,I hear you've given up smoking.
6562305,eng,Just tell him you’re not interested.
5551007,eng,Tom ate a frozen dinner.
6029342,eng,Leave me alone! Can't you see I'm busy?
7035349,eng,I was good friends with my teacher.
2952907,eng,I've had a high fever for three days.
311383,eng,She had the whole summer off that year.
3915545,eng,I can hear them.
67255,eng,"One professor says that even if Alex is using words, it's wrong to call it a language."
10650554,eng,Brush your teeth before going to sleep.
1521753,eng,I don't pay attention to the rumors I hear; let everyone do as they please with their life.
24082,eng,Please give my best to the entire family.
5747667,eng,Tom isn't feeling great.
8979482,eng,I do that as much as Tom does.
8775127,eng,Is it the blanket with the wavy pattern?
9448882,eng,The first thing you have to do is pack your suitcase.
6257789,eng,Did you know that was happening?
2300685,eng,I can do whatever I want.
946982,eng,Chechens have inclinations towards independence.
7143967,eng,I didn't think that Tom would be forgiven for doing that.
9243488,eng,The carp jumped out of the water.
8915221,eng,I lay awake most of the night.
3312684,eng,"We hear you, Tom."
7774385,eng,It would be better to leave that to the experts.
10236822,eng,Ziri asked Rima if he could borrow her corkscrew.
8549886,eng,Giraffes have thick skin.
3914290,eng,Keep them there.
2644750,eng,Tom's not ready for that.
7429205,eng,Are you having any luck?
10222394,eng,Ziri was surfing the web.
7732829,eng,Tom was there to protect us.
3919706,eng,Look at her move.
292388,eng,He was reading a newspaper in his pajamas.
6511733,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were feeling tired.
3392637,eng,Let's just say things didn't go exactly as planned.
6416748,eng,Mary told me that she thought Tom was tired.
8526898,eng,"He's very angry, isn't he?"
8026893,eng,What's your favorite hair color?
6223769,eng,Tom says he might not have to do that.
6670766,eng,Lidar is revolutionising archaeology.
7385036,eng,She gets up before her parents do.
7513518,eng,"You do know you should do that, don't you?"
1938809,eng,I thought Tom would live forever.
3991229,eng,Dan committed the worst imaginable crime.
8480274,eng,He's my hostage.
10053944,eng,They're still my children.
9807667,eng,"Yanni was short of stature, but he was very strong."
8500037,eng,"Can I see your belly button? ""No, you can't."""
328123,eng,"Asami was bawling that you had kissed Sanada so ""I didn't bawl!"""
7514339,eng,Tom told me John was a terrible roommate.
2273628,eng,Tom is wearing gloves.
807124,eng,President Roosevelt was furious.
7523509,eng,"When Meredith bought this northern Texas land several years ago, it was overgrazed and overrun with weeds. Now, she’s thrilled to find a dark green blob of fungus she rolls under her sparkly-nail-polished thumb."
10232673,eng,Ziri woke up to a knocking noise.
4777058,eng,This pulao tastes great!
10248473,eng,This story is in two parts.
6912698,eng,Do you plan to get married before you're thirty?
7184598,eng,"I didn't want to go to Australia last month, but I had no choice."
10142817,eng,Tom is smarter than your average college sophomore.
6435476,eng,Did you do anything special last night?
5163880,eng,I'm well today.
9706237,eng,Do I still have time left?
6649811,eng,Tom said that he hoped Mary would come to his concert.
3327768,eng,Can you finish by then?
10455423,eng,"Since Tom has been cycling every day, he's become much thinner."
6273448,eng,Tom is always barefoot.
2817646,eng,You're not even close to the right answer.
5850598,eng,Mary is a very elegant woman.
1951872,eng,You can't hold me responsible.
2854034,eng,I'd like to go out with Emily.
262162,eng,I will go abroad next year.
6439991,eng,Tom's real name is John.
3921712,eng,Tom will never forget Mary.
10054644,eng,"Mandarin only has four tones, while Cantonese has six to nine."
7544706,eng,We won't have another chance to do that anytime in the near future.
8838763,eng,"The heliocentric view of the world, in which the Sun is at the centre of the universe, is also described as the Copernican system. It represents a step forward from the geocentric view of Ptolemy."

7866508,eng,Algerians are very proud people.
5807400,eng,Do you know what would happen if you drank that?
9020717,eng,The trip will take approximately three hours.
6343350,eng,Tom would probably be willing to do that.
6490350,eng,Tom and Mary said they've only gone sailing three times.
43428,eng,The train is traveling at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
9247004,eng,Yanni wanted to take revenge on Skura's family.
665565,eng,"After three hours in the casino, he's $2,000 in the hole."
3599536,eng,"Life is a jest, and all things show it, I thought so once, and now I know it."
3170686,eng,That's a nice shade of blue.
8021231,eng,Give a shout if you need anything.
6269754,eng,Tom doesn't think Mary will be ready.
2455513,eng,"Concerning this computer, it broke a few days ago."
2202745,eng,You're dependable.
9323494,eng,"A Chabad rabbi, Abraham Chen, saw Peter Kropotkin as a tsadik."
1214897,eng,"I couldn't go out, due to the heavy rain."
754747,eng,My mother often gives pies to passers-by.
284409,eng,I'll fix it up with him.
6421657,eng,Mary said she needed to take a shower.
5769618,eng,Tom's mother was aghast.
5848185,eng,Tom made one serious mistake.
311918,eng,She drank two glasses of wine at the party.
278083,eng,"Better short and sweet, than long and lax."
6342121,eng,I think that Tom will agree to do that.
18231,eng,Air is invisible.
6242197,eng,I didn't want to admit that I was scared.
2433566,eng,Tom wishes he could speak French as well as Mary does.
6514790,eng,Tom and Mary say they enjoy studying French.
8519347,eng,He showed some photos to her.
1891679,eng,He was promoted to the position of school principal.
7509022,eng,Tom has already decided he's going to stay here.
2342542,eng,Can someone explain this to me?
3154903,eng,A lot of people prefer to eat fried chicken with their fingers.
5455101,eng,I am not gay!
6602074,eng,Tom had foreseen his reproaches.
6528120,eng,Tom decided to give Mary a second chance.
3181585,eng,We need to talk face to face.
3204134,eng,I can't tell whether it's raining or not.
8947033,eng,How bad is the food?
681119,eng,We hired a guide for our white-water rafting trip.
8800850,eng,Little is known about Mercury.
7190216,eng,Sami's service dog needs to pay attention to him and shouldn't be distracted by other people.
6435776,eng,I have many other things I have to do.
257376,eng,I had the luck to find a good job.
58580,eng,We have had lots of typhoons this fall.
33800,eng,"Ben, if anything, is a sensible man."
8432469,eng,Tom was attacked by an unknown man in the subway.
10080000,eng,Algeria needs sustainable industry.
8792165,eng,Skura and Nuja were pleased.
9242040,eng,Yanni continued to talk softly.
10287475,eng,I hurt my leg playing football.
10551471,eng,Tom was a victim of stray gunfire.
6864979,eng,You don't get what I'm saying.
10643397,eng,The patient is being treated in ICU.
8811764,eng,I'm an architecture student.
2038373,eng,Owls are wise.
6043826,eng,Layla didn't deserve to die like this.
7286181,eng,Sami winked at my ass.
6407272,eng,I wonder whether we forgot to tell Mary she was supposed to do that.
6229769,eng,"Tom knew he should say something, but he didn't know what to say."
9931826,eng,Everyone except for Tom brought a surfboard.
8132942,eng,Venus has a thick atmosphere.
6658637,eng,Tom said Mary didn't look particularly worried.
287100,eng,He is very blunt in his manner.
2483549,eng,Can someone give me a sensible answer to this question?
320682,eng,My mother is still working in the kitchen.
4577246,eng,You're just making stuff up.
4646144,eng,"It's hard to be a woman. One must think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl, and work like a horse."
253099,eng,I know a girl who is always smiling.
7541994,eng,Tom didn't seem to have very much money.
9842606,eng,Why is Rome unfortified?
10240907,eng,Ziri followed Rima on social media.
5752344,eng,This is no different.
3490519,eng,Tom was out of town last week.
8585358,eng,They cost three Euros a piece.
8456419,eng,Tom's closest friend is his dog.
9387423,eng,I think that what Tom said is true.
6662076,eng,Tom did everything Mary told him to.
40881,eng,I just felt like hearing the sound of your voice.
5170766,eng,I'm not having them drink.
7390149,eng,She never did finish her homework.
1028045,eng,Tom should know better than to ask Mary for a loan.
5239506,eng,I know things you don't know.
2949966,eng,Why does no one believe me when I'm telling the truth?
304357,eng,He did a courageous act.
2016840,eng,Don't you want to know what I want?
5746760,eng,I know I'll feel better.
9474958,eng,Tom must've gone to the doctor.
5587236,eng,Why did you say yes if you didn't want to go?
6616309,eng,Tom was arrested for insider trading.
10217912,eng,Entertainment is still popular with young people in Japan.
7807506,eng,Tom appeared to be unresponsive.
7438378,eng,They said that they could probably do that.
8100026,eng,You're a pain in the ass!
239907,eng,Many times I've been alone.
68877,eng,You must not play.
7379956,eng,Mary went to her room to study.
6646116,eng,Tom's parents allow Tom to do what he wants.
8780723,eng,This is a Tuareg sword.
8373750,eng,Algerians aren't scared of assholes.
6342953,eng,Tom will probably be waiting in the lobby.
5736251,eng,We need this issue resolved.
3593526,eng,The word ‘kilogram’ is usually abbreviated to ‘kg’.
5165055,eng,Over the holidays I didn't do anything.
7439121,eng,They said that they'd do that for you.
6527204,eng,Tom said that he wasn't going to be very late.
6657895,eng,Tom ate lunch with Mary.
7175367,eng,Tom thought that Mary wasn't yet finished doing that.
9525243,eng,That boy talks like a girl.
9955956,eng,This work is so simple even a child can do it.
5852162,eng,Tom said that I looked annoyed.
7166236,eng,Sami's sister passed away six days ago.
5867061,eng,"With the destructive power of today's weapons, keeping the peace is not just a goal; it's a sacred obligation."
4877627,eng,Are we going to succeed?
10770523,eng,"With her, it goes in one ear and out the other."
6496930,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd be able to do that without any help.
3172382,eng,Are you faithful?
1024962,eng,Tom is looking for someone to help him build a wall.
8527782,eng,"She's going to pass, isn't she?"
3590617,eng,We wear the same size.
2717779,eng,Some people consider Led Zeppelin the greatest band ever.
7539724,eng,Tom and his grandmother have gone to the bookstore.
5193346,eng,I want you to do that as soon as possible.
2045856,eng,Have I ever told you how beautiful you are?
8275994,eng,What do you believe about Jesus?
4402106,eng,Finally he was there.
8978181,eng,I want to dance with Tom.
7198985,eng,It's not big.
2251059,eng,That's certainly possible.
2471835,eng,Tom didn't raise his voice.
9237935,eng,Tom will probably not believe you.
9470821,eng,I do not understand. What's the point of this task?
6411112,eng,Mary is going to have to take better care of herself.
6430419,eng,Tom might kiss Mary today.
9823952,eng,"Those dolls weren't easy to sell, but I finally sold all of them."
6508342,eng,Tom and Mary say they haven't done anything wrong.
4614620,eng,We're back from China.
7113829,eng,Was I supposed to kiss Tom?
2547166,eng,I'm not following you.
1240109,eng,Congratulations to all!
6375630,eng,This engine works perfectly.
10031152,eng,Yanni is Skura's office spouse.
6420349,eng,Mary has her reasons for not doing that.
6411175,eng,Mary claims she didn't know that was going to happen.
1884862,eng,Don't love two people at the same time.
326253,eng,The trains are running behind time.
2033746,eng,"If you want a sandwich, raise your hand."
8918666,eng,It's defective.
5216326,eng,I told Tom to leave it alone.
5938375,eng,Tom has lost his key.
6436227,eng,Tom said that Mary is in Boston now.
6514767,eng,Let's find out where Tom and Mary live.
10512827,eng,The price of oil continues to rise.
1723943,eng,It was nowhere to be seen.
9762629,eng,Will Yanni and Skura stop us?
6422117,eng,Mary will get mad if she doesn't win.
8789606,eng,I ran past Skura.
9444118,eng,That was definitely one of the funniest jokes Tom told last night.
10770458,eng,They say that time is a fire in which we burn.
2251220,eng,That's quite powerful.
6495894,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't believe you really want to do that.
261318,eng,I don't like the way she speaks.
6436981,eng,"Tom isn't still doing that, is he?"
29494,eng,Reports are due next Monday.
8409426,eng,He turned her down.
2662342,eng,That foul odor is coming from the river.
5825774,eng,That has been my experience anyhow.
7213378,eng,Sami didn't know what to say about that.
6663731,eng,Is this cane Tom's?
6008,eng,I'm taking a walk in a park.
4013569,eng,What's wrong with the refrigerator?
8527162,eng,"He's drunk again, isn't he?"
10099162,eng,Tom came to bother them.
1901595,eng,You look like a girl.
7442913,eng,Tom and Mary know that they cheated.
6646812,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary would be confused.
7130222,eng,Tom and Mary are pleased with the decision.
6447853,eng,There were more than a thousand men in the mosque.
6250789,eng,Tom said you need to be more careful.
4015325,eng,Tom said he would do his homework by himself.
3825648,eng,This is so comfortable.
3424284,eng,Tom stole the diamond.
3358918,eng,You guys make a great team.
286700,eng,"But for his help, your success would be impossible."
10061072,eng,I fell into a trap.
6234165,eng,Tom would like to hear the reason why you did that.
264252,eng,Please tell me when the next meeting will be held.
6810708,eng,Sami knew there was something in there.
7561641,eng,A study showed that eating too fast contributes to obesity.
6048861,eng,Am I just being paranoid again?
7160636,eng,Sami showed the cops this video.
4823688,eng,For several days I've felt the need to write you.
7158940,eng,I'll be in Australia for another three days.
10699014,eng,Settle down comfortably and listen.
6353263,eng,Tom wouldn't do that alone.
4497931,eng,Everybody was doing it.
7215336,eng,Sami is not dead.
7389028,eng,She's liked by her friends.
2831165,eng,Whoever doesn't capitalize when the opportunity presents itself will later regret not having used the chance.
1528593,eng,I'm free anytime.
6357504,eng,I wouldn't buy that.
6087999,eng,I think doing that wouldn't help.
6376674,eng,Would you leave your wife to travel with me?
7137230,eng,"Tom is on the other bus, isn't he?"
5729506,eng,I don't know how I got that job.
1072190,eng,"Suffice to say, Edna gets no work done."
8249042,eng,Do you believe in the trinity?
6433954,eng,"Tom is going to help Mary do that, I think."
6345901,eng,Why does Tom want to be a doctor?
6616372,eng,They made off with the money on a motorbike.
4014918,eng,"Here, use my key."
6264426,eng,Tom wondered where Mary had studied French.
10680119,eng,"If I had more money, I would move to a bigger house."
7734951,eng,I'm pretty reluctant to do that right now.
8199223,eng,Who is her father?
283317,eng,My uncle would not have employed him but that he was very energetic.
4499141,eng,"Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."
8314031,eng,Can you spell this Berber word?
3497752,eng,Tom was found murdered this morning.
6422682,eng,Mary has decided that she'll do that.
10705137,eng,I definitely didn't say that.
3168573,eng,What you're saying is true.
638418,eng,"In a minute, I'm going to tell you my life story."
8657100,eng,"In the interim, I will serve as chairman."
9990060,eng,Yanni was walking backards.
2476475,eng,I would have at the least used it.
4558934,eng,The scholarship gave me a chance to continue my studies.
6523973,eng,I wonder whether Tom told Mary she had to do that or not.
6665626,eng,I got back on my motorcycle.
10232790,eng,Ziri isn't feeling it.
7177678,eng,Tom said that Mary was enjoying herself in Boston.
9870649,eng,I can't stop until he tells me to.
6661626,eng,Tom hid the stolen money in a cardboard box in his basement.
55449,eng,This is too easy for him.
6423757,eng,Mary told us she thought she'd win.
6635429,eng,"Mary told Tom she finds porn repulsive, so he quitted watching it."
6715910,eng,Sami died in Layla's house.
10596404,eng,It's finally more or less explained.
1078802,eng,Tom was sitting on a bench eating something that looked like an apple.
2251973,eng,Does this document refresh your recollection?
2951574,eng,Can you just get Tom some water?
10136740,eng,Water scarcity has become more common in Algeria.
10187728,eng,I'm beat.
6252907,eng,Is there any other way to do that?
6269693,eng,I didn't have a good day.
7143630,eng,I didn't think that Tom would permit Mary to do that.
7214276,eng,Tom told me that he wanted to help.
6517628,eng,Tom and Mary told me they wanted to quit.
7962408,eng,I was sure you would change your mind.
6826883,eng,I should never have said that.
9795902,eng,"By the river, there are elegant gray buildings."
2438316,eng,Please wake up at 7.
1897800,eng,That's not even funny.
6267510,eng,Tom and I sat across from John and Mary.
2774254,eng,How many Canadian friends do you have?
7397986,eng,He bought what he needed to buy.
7143080,eng,I didn't think that what I did was wrong.
7231461,eng,I don't think that I'll likely do that.
5207933,eng,Stop playing the fool.
3732738,eng,I thought Tom might ask Mary to the dance.
6143125,eng,I've done that a lot of times.
10603451,eng,Ziri ate something delicious.
10031154,eng,Why don't we do it the same way we did it yesterday?
65506,eng,Our budget won't allow that luxury.
9194463,eng,Is it because he's blond?
7912163,eng,Open wings.
3804846,eng,He was an idol.
2635891,eng,Let me be clear.
2584991,eng,What is she doing with him?
3916562,eng,Is that from him?
6354839,eng,Tom is still quicker at doing that than Mary.
3915942,eng,Can you give him a ride home?
4496485,eng,We should change it.
10479658,eng,Just put your stuff in there.
903701,eng,There is an urgent need for more people to donate their time and money.
8574084,eng,There are no diplomatic relations between Algeria and Nauru.
6223094,eng,Tom is also expected to participate.
6013599,eng,What is that made of?
8543737,eng,I want to learn how to say a few words in Upper Sorbian.
282402,eng,Don't be silly.
1769913,eng,Where did you buy this watermelon from?
6266911,eng,Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
10169290,eng,Will you take care of my dog while I'm away?
6838791,eng,"I knew that if I let Tom leave, he'd never come back."
3233595,eng,The plane was flying far above the clouds.
258789,eng,I want a new tennis racket.
5859531,eng,I may not be wrong.
4846659,eng,She's combing her hair.
9754280,eng,The story sounds believable.
17621,eng,He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
6997587,eng,Tom said that he'd be there by 2:30.
3820732,eng,Tell me if it isn't so.
270162,eng,Never trust a stranger.
6503465,eng,Tom and Mary wanted to spend time with their children.
2804243,eng,We still have a lot to cover.
7114115,eng,I didn't bat an eye.
8177869,eng,Tom filled the bathtub up with hot water.
2258984,eng,It's a solvent firm.
298725,eng,He exhibited no remorse for his crime.
3024314,eng,I know a couple of good restaurants on Park Street.
7395577,eng,He says he's prepared to do that.
2190290,eng,He told me good things about you.
7375603,eng,Mary isn't as poor as she used to be.
8414845,eng,Muslims should help anybody around them.
10533027,eng,"Ziri and Rima are your family, too."
3120956,eng,He squeezed her hand.
2359351,eng,I've been working since I was thirteen.
9096740,eng,When will this paper's latest edition be out?
7540386,eng,Tom and Mary were walking in the park together.
5876308,eng,Layla envied Sofia so much as a teenager.
3129312,eng,Has it happened to you?
5826422,eng,How could you agree to doing that without consulting me?
5023341,eng,"My parents went to church, but I did not go."
6052871,eng,He's better looking than you.
64892,eng,It's to see your face well.
6868883,eng,You should have told me that yesterday.
6004002,eng,Do souls exist?
3201580,eng,You've got to tell me what to do.
8535005,eng,He's from Boston and so is she.
486457,eng,My nephew was excused because of his youth.
8204931,eng,It's a very strange place.
2576062,eng,Bush does his best to protect the environment.
1461082,eng,Taro speaks English better than me.
6877875,eng,Don't congratulate me!
3957944,eng,"Newton explained the movement of orbiting planets as the result of motion along a straight line combined with the gravitational pull of the Sun. His laws are all based on the idea that nothing is naturally at rest. He reasoned that all heavenly bodies are constantly moving, with no limits on space and time."
8054911,eng,Mennad's gym shoes are stinking.
6410818,eng,Mary was sitting at her desk the last time I saw her.
8908328,eng,I hope that you're not like everybody else.
3573717,eng,Your locker is open.
10303672,eng,They're a bunch of idiots.
8495254,eng,Where's your belly button?
321955,eng,I was disguised in girl's clothes at the school festival.
7154827,eng,Tom said that he wished that he hadn't told Mary that he'd go to Australia with her.
7731879,eng,Tom is the only one who understands Mary.
3221367,eng,"I may be poor, but I'm not stupid."
3359699,eng,I've got two kids in school.
7159024,eng,I wish I'd gone to Australia.
5828659,eng,I cheated.
6616843,eng,Eat some citrus.
5548570,eng,We probably won't do that again.
9995355,eng,Yanni was stranded.
7205258,eng,Sami was dating a girl.
3393013,eng,Get back in there.
3157449,eng,Tom couldn't convince Mary to accept his money.
327353,eng,The Rangers lead the way.
7183647,eng,Sami recorded it.
1169446,eng,"In chapter twenty-eight of these prophecies you have one of the most amazing, startling and terrible things in the Bible - the king of Tyre."
283656,eng,Do you know the reason why he cut class today?
3431155,eng,Tom isn't going to care.
513160,eng,My mother tongue is Spanish.
3673611,eng,We don't get along very well.
6269322,eng,Tom still wants to do that with Mary.
2793015,eng,I hope there is a resolution of this problem.
1016616,eng,My throat hurts and my body feels heavy. It looks like I've caught a cold somehow.
2691883,eng,What's all this crap?
3729761,eng,I think I've found enough for everybody.
6388687,eng,Sami wants to finish this project.
8895627,eng,Oat porridge tastes best with milk.
8110392,eng,"Oh, my God!"
7212505,eng,I would've thought that you would've done that.
7154858,eng,Tom said that he thought that he wouldn't enjoy going to Australia with Mary.
8651601,eng,Look how I do it.
5661514,eng,This is a classic.
7130561,eng,Tom isn't as callous as he used to be.
1331543,eng,I'm living a mystical experience.
7378977,eng,Mary is too weak to lift herself.
6695377,eng,The sentences proliferate like rabbits. But it's good.
6658770,eng,Tom has lived in Boston for many years.
2645514,eng,How's Tom doing at work?
2901126,eng,I saw a man get arrested by the police a few minutes ago.
6490805,eng,Tom and Mary paid someone to help them move the piano.
3373060,eng,"You know I'm not coming back, don't you?"
6855517,eng,It's only awkward if you make it so.
321561,eng,"I tried this and that, blending yellow with white powders and obtaining brown, mixing crystals with powders and getting dust, combining liquids with solids and making mud."
2511665,eng,"In a quivering voice she cried ""Help!"""
7444398,eng,They told me that they weren't upset.
5937903,eng,I have a lot in common with Tom.
6673795,eng,He is ugly.
3903758,eng,I've been hunting with them.
3313156,eng,We can come right away.
6337454,eng,I think Tom may leave on Monday.
5216971,eng,I burnt my fingers on the hob this morning.
3565869,eng,Aren't you a little too young to be dating a guy as old as Tom?
8567657,eng,Has Tom asked you to marry him?
2097691,eng,"I'm innocent, I swear."
1860160,eng,The clock has stopped. It needs a new battery.
6687109,eng,Sami is thirty-six but looks ten years younger.
8223001,eng,"Of all the people of the Mediterranean region, Algerians are perhaps the craziest and most unpredictable. Never mess with an Algerian unless you're crazy and don't know what you're doing."

315163,eng,She contributed an article to the newspaper.
807576,eng,Thousands of people went to see the President.
6124399,eng,I'll ask Tom to make sure Mary does that.
1875893,eng,It's fun to go out with her.
7375899,eng,Mary has apparently changed her mind.
6678344,eng,"If I'd known about it, I would've told you."
3822156,eng,Are you two musicians?
657170,eng,The police found no signs of foul play in the apartment.
7389502,eng,She said that she lost her key.
319488,eng,Few children were in the room.
5020267,eng,We hope that storks will come to us again and again.
10744668,eng,What Tom said would happen happened.
6662777,eng,Tom uses the same dictionary that his father used as a student.
6647854,eng,Tom said that he's glad that nobody was injured in the accident.
8674928,eng,They help keep the teeth clean.
4888456,eng,I'll have to do that.
7182539,eng,Tom said that he knew that Boston was where Mary was going.
875657,eng,The airplane was going to carry them to Bauru.
8838606,eng,He accompanies his songs with sad chords played on a dodgy zither.
411242,eng,"I like this color, too."
6037955,eng,"The sound exists in the language, but only as an allophone."
8527691,eng,"She's a little nuts, isn't she?"
681601,eng,Tom likes to observe the people walking by.
2867036,eng,"You like beans, don't you?"
6663777,eng,I hope I'm not doing this wrong.
2361351,eng,I don't mean to nag you.
8285339,eng,She didn't tell me this.
6432254,eng,Tom told me he doesn't want to spend time in jail.
278747,eng,Iron is the most useful metal.
2649178,eng,Were you busy?
17745,eng,We thought it wrong that you should punish him.
6025119,eng,It is difficult for me to control my emotions.
2643814,eng,Why are you always so busy?
8515877,eng,She told me she used to be married to him.
7185052,eng,Sami kept waking Layla up.
6013500,eng,I'm getting older and I don't want to work at night anymore.
6504834,eng,Tom and Mary told me they wanted to do that tomorrow.
10213416,eng,Ziri was quivering.
4980063,eng,I passed the test.
5746262,eng,My life is a soap opera.
6713811,eng,Sami was in the police interrogation room.
6365868,eng,I really didn't mean to hurt you.
5726150,eng,We keep trying to make it better.
10701938,eng,What are those vertical lines you see next to some atomic test explosion?
6018958,eng,I'm too rich.
10794444,eng,"What's the opposite of ""cold?"""
8536824,eng,He told me he wanted to do that by himself.
7149079,eng,Sami should be fired.
8440112,eng,You have a beautiful daughter.
804189,eng,It appeared that war would come.
6236240,eng,I should've stayed in Boston for another week.
5823437,eng,It was clear that Tom didn't want to sing.
6407060,eng,Mary probably doesn't have enough time to do that before she goes home.
6348050,eng,Tom said he believed he could win.
2648858,eng,"Bring it on, Tom."
1123540,eng,"What marvelous work he's doing, donating books to needy children!"
6573817,eng,He is racing home to clear his brower's history.
6709612,eng,Sami came up with an alternate plan.
38651,eng,Why can Taro speak English so well?
6423900,eng,Mary said that she'd come tomorrow.
3729637,eng,I can't possibly stay.
913545,eng,President Barack Obama praised Poland as an example for aspiring democracies in the Middle East and elsewhere.
1313275,eng,Was she really boring?
3737982,eng,Where did you get this stuff?
3428300,eng,Tom looks a lot like his father.
5573343,eng,Can I ask you some questions?
6433053,eng,I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for Mary.
1388231,eng,Everyone is looking forward to watching the game.
7357025,eng,How much did this chair cost you?
3738148,eng,What makes you think I don't like Tom?
8610455,eng,Avoid touching your face.
1026067,eng,Tom doesn't know which button to push.
6715552,eng,Sami filled a glass with antifreeze.
2248898,eng,It was vague.
10292535,eng,Someday I'd like to go to Australia.
10588524,eng,"Luckily, my mom agreed right away."
10676547,eng,He discovered the pink pole.
882725,eng,She and I are Brazilian.
6650345,eng,Tom said that he didn't know that Mary was going to have to do that next week.
1553482,eng,I cut myself.
4144867,eng,I don't understand what you're doing.
2042653,eng,I don't want to go through another experience like that.
7223100,eng,There's no chance Tom will ever do that.
3902941,eng,Don't go anywhere without him.
6343025,eng,Tom told me he wasn't very good at French.
10130191,eng,"Jerusalem is the third holy city in Islam, following Mecca and Medina."
2955988,eng,Tom asked me if I knew what time the meeting was going to start.
3579601,eng,"The referee, according to principle of advantage, raised his hand and motioned for the advance to continue."
9181587,eng,Is Tom older than me?
3822135,eng,It's interesting that both of you have the same name.
6029194,eng,I'm sending two photographs as attachments.
45462,eng,I am not sure how to pronounce the word.
7264482,eng,Tom did some quick math in his head.
10210472,eng,Ziri served the kids lemonade.
10210364,eng,Ziri spent the night studying.
41792,eng,Say it in another way.
6736273,eng,I'm not very impressed.
877785,eng,Cairo is the biggest city in Africa.
7171951,eng,I thought that you were dead.
296755,eng,He went to a fruit store first.
3905734,eng,Should I not have told them?
6531765,eng,Tom is going to fix that.
2011827,eng,We do anything we want.
7198925,eng,It's not what I thought.
5745993,eng,Was that the right call?
7132300,eng,I didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
5738401,eng,Tom may well get very angry.
4012910,eng,Where did Tom learn how to play the guitar like that?
9359614,eng,Why are clementines so addictive?
5681868,eng,Tom and Mary first met a month ago.
10025754,eng,There's nothing wrong with remaining silent when there's nothing to say.
10479510,eng,Most people use this phrase without any idea about its origin.
317562,eng,Don't make fun of her. She just chugged three bottles of beer.
5487142,eng,Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.
1230182,eng,"The cat chased the mouse, but it couldn't catch it."
2263433,eng,I think I broke his heart.
10026570,eng,Yanni can speak Berber and Japanese.
3071360,eng,Who's going to try your case?
7508858,eng,I didn't know that Tom knew who did that for him.
6385606,eng,Sami will come when he's ready.
842703,eng,Choose a current affairs issue.
1028861,eng,Tom got a call from someone named Mary.
7443653,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they enjoyed the view.
43650,eng,The problem was under discussion.
7543462,eng,Tom is a lot of fun to be around.
2387561,eng,I need to ask you some questions.
7184227,eng,I didn't think that you were in Australia.
9977831,eng,Yanni is a sheriff.
43333,eng,The old couple sat side by side.
10703702,eng,I've been studying English since 1995.
2074220,eng,Our teacher is in a good mood.
8244245,eng,Tom doesn't care what Mary said.
6084012,eng,Do you think Tom would be willing to do that for me?
7165130,eng,Sami shouldn't move in with Layla.
7402861,eng,He said that he was afraid.
8293009,eng,Every maniac likes his hat.
3821262,eng,I'm not a mind reader.
7736116,eng,Tom gets bullied a lot.
6354070,eng,Tom wasn't a good student.
6357916,eng,Tom told me he owed Mary $300.
9841893,eng,That's appropriate.
4297226,eng,"When you're young and you're in love, the world seems beautiful."
7380737,eng,Mary looks like she's trapped.
7231958,eng,I don't think Tom understood what we wanted him to do.
10765125,eng,Tom needs to be more patient.
423353,eng,They went to the station by car.
8183764,eng,I thought the woman that I met yesterday was Tom's mother.
5852885,eng,I began coughing.
9050304,eng,Yanni couldn't talk because he was intubated.
65686,eng,Mr Wilson is proud of his house.
8370210,eng,I didn't dare tell Tom my secret.
9725516,eng,Yanni was young.
9199867,eng,Your bike's handlebars are too low.
2092166,eng,Be careful not to miss the train.
5099045,eng,Most of them just don't care.
10635931,eng,He's got a fixation.
52472,eng,Singapore's Central Fund provides pensions.
1680145,eng,This is the first time I've ever burnt my pants with a cigarette.
6831543,eng,The children were chasing each other and laughing.
6231007,eng,I didn't notice that Tom was wearing a wedding ring.
9341315,eng,"“Sylvia's in Harlem does not invent what is sometimes called down-home food or soul food, but it exemplifies that kind of cuisine and is also an example of the story of African American migration from the South to the North,” Freedman says."
10339846,eng,"There's no reason why you can't stay for a few more days, right?"
7129568,eng,Everybody wanted to be Tom's friend.
8422622,eng,"In the day of a certain festival, when he would have prepared a hearty feast at home, he would send his son to invite a few of his friends to the meal."
8948483,eng,Tom wasn't aggressive.
7473477,eng,They say they're feeling kind of tired.
5557234,eng,We expect a lot from Tom.
6048940,eng,Tom was here for quite a while.
7844489,eng,Going to sleep and waking up early is good for the body.
7543598,eng,Tom seemed to enjoy the concert.
6417385,eng,Have you told Mary what she should be doing?
6658868,eng,Tom cleared his throat and started speaking.
3315109,eng,Leaving Boston was the biggest mistake I ever made.
803208,eng,He did not live to see the end of the war.
6330852,eng,Sami did that for seven weeks.
6653767,eng,Tom said that he hated being treated like a child.
10787716,eng,Ring me before you set off.
3464066,eng,Security before everything else.
3455718,eng,Don't you ever dust this place?
6694451,eng,Sami forced the door open.
3172171,eng,How is Tom?
6864879,eng,Which pair of shoes fit you better?
2385319,eng,He will drink the champagne at midnight.
241494,eng,"Black people had to sit in the back of the bus, or stand if the back was full."
6660033,eng,I had another argument with Tom.
244904,eng,"Cherry blossoms last only for days, a week at the most."
2645987,eng,They say they know you.
9705496,eng,It would be nice if I had a car.
2952672,eng,I wonder if I should trust my instincts.
10767110,eng,US missiles were raining down from the skies.
727136,eng,Along the whole length of the pew hymnals are placed at regular intervals.
9399335,eng,Tom didn't finish the song that he was writing.
241519,eng,With his muscular constitution he passes for a judoist.
8235602,eng,The water in the river is up to the knee.
6918903,eng,We bought a house on credit.
6234817,eng,I can play both tennis and baseball fairly well.
8109785,eng,Peculiar. I would never think about it this way.
3201778,eng,What was it you wanted to tell me?
259091,eng,I ran across an old friend of mine at party the other day.
1961768,eng,I thought you were mad at Tom.
7242099,eng,Sami got fired from that school.
8535655,eng,She can fix it herself.
6348737,eng,I thought we could sing together.
6424396,eng,Mary won't let me hug her anymore.
6435201,eng,Tom spent the whole afternoon studying.
3915490,eng,They heard him.
46258,eng,The evidence left no room for uncertainty.
9978945,eng,Stalin was a bad person.
6517390,eng,"Tom and Mary are pretty rich, aren't they?"

8173651,eng,Tom injured his knee.
9840134,eng,There's a book on the desk about dancing.
7748048,eng,He just comes and goes.
2253878,eng,Wasn't that fun?
2736109,eng,I've just lost my new black wallet.
293746,eng,He emphasized the importance of working hard.
2509475,eng,This is a dead-end street.
2547877,eng,I'd better go myself.
2292340,eng,If only she could see you now.
908714,eng,Who's your favorite historical person?
6229942,eng,Tom invited me to stay a couple of weeks at his place in Boston.
7269781,eng,I’m going to Washington.
1893769,eng,We must do it again.
51318,eng,I would very much like to go.
4426690,eng,The woman used a nasal spray because she had a severe cold.
7399443,eng,He told me he was feeling bad.
6680461,eng,There are a couple of very tall trees in our backyard.
6200208,eng,He's giving blood to save his sister.
6338429,eng,I recommend not doing that the way Tom suggested.
2138762,eng,I've married the wrong person.
9821056,eng,Tom likes cupcakes.
10490556,eng,And don't fall asleep in the bathtub!
3530017,eng,God is everywhere but He is most manifest in man. So serve man as God. That is as good as worshipping God.
2007933,eng,Let's go in.
8577215,eng,He had a white book under his arm.
7279947,eng,Sami isn't interested in hearing about that.
7645320,eng,The coffee is on me.
1748250,eng,Which sport do you like practising?
9288712,eng,I hope I didn't rack your brain too hard with all these thoughts.
5823028,eng,Do you wanna go see them by yourself?
6241914,eng,Tom and I started talking at the same time.
3733131,eng,Perhaps we can talk about this at another time.
9690381,eng,Is there anything else you need to know about me?
306023,eng,They gave us very little trouble.
9954050,eng,He's always leaving his keys somewhere.
7472020,eng,Tom and Mary said the decision was theirs.
7856742,eng,Algeria doesn't have a demographic crisis.
6676771,eng,I have to go through my bedtime ritual.
2175932,eng,It seems no one paid any attention to what he said.
8130495,eng,Could she really be interested in him?
3903491,eng,Who's with them now?
6524546,eng,I think everybody needs to do that.
6693681,eng,Sami lived hundreds of miles away.
10736271,eng,Mary was afraid of being discovered.
3378696,eng,What else did you do there?
2922450,eng,Life is a short walk before eternal sleep.
802573,eng,They said they only wanted to be left alone.
3818272,eng,I'm always happy to see you.
6673178,eng,I came as soon as I heard you needed me.
7113654,eng,Tom's fate is sealed.
9392808,eng,Do you recognize any of those people?
7156659,eng,Sami did it in front of my face.
2202414,eng,My dear mother.
1166430,eng,"If you're so dissatisfied with what I'm doing, you'd be better off doing it yourself."
6229410,eng,I don't think Tom is honest.
4733274,eng,Don't mourn.
6492667,eng,Tom and Mary said John thought they might be required to do that by themselves.
9077295,eng,Tom told me it didn't matter.
8233646,eng,I think that that's a very annoying sound.
680095,eng,Tom advised the job applicant to redo her resume.
6506454,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary know much about that.
7407966,eng,They changed their plans.
5102515,eng,"How are you, guys?"
5886537,eng,Fadil met Layla on a bus.
6505941,eng,"As far as I know, Tom and Mary haven't done that."
6429995,eng,"You're planning on helping again tomorrow, aren't you?"
8010855,eng,Mennad looked at his mobile phone for a second.
10781306,eng,It won't be long until Tom is here.
8427399,eng,At last Tom started learning Esperanto.
7110849,eng,I think Tom is distracted.
2241077,eng,We didn't notice.
10529204,eng,Tom is a rich person.
416847,eng,Knock on the door of happiness.
6245060,eng,I think Tom could manage to do that.
8054505,eng,I don't want to ruin Christmas for you.
4317128,eng,Do you know how to differentiate between poison ivy and poison oak plants?
3732164,eng,Tell Tom I'll be there by 2:30.
2592611,eng,A flag is a symbol of the nation.
7165039,eng,Layla started to do my makeup.
954572,eng,What should I do with the books on the table?
7381517,eng,Mary thought she might win.
267205,eng,A girl gave me an orange in exchange for a piece of cake.
1164492,eng,Tom is very blunt.
10608819,eng,We are the mirrors of the world in which we dwell.
6269602,eng,Tom and I'll meet you there.
6972191,eng,"It is the man who tells, or who acts a lie, that is guilty, and not he who honestly and sincerily believes the lie."
5502529,eng,I'm not certain that I can trust Tom.
8477746,eng,He fell silent.
10221794,eng,Ziri wore red pants.
8960636,eng,Thanks for coming over at such short notice.
258483,eng,I will devote myself to studying for the entrance exams.
6111547,eng,Layla froze to death.
2870355,eng,Is that all you have to say?
7470762,eng,Tom and Mary had nobody to tell their stories to.
8259959,eng,When did you pick up the Berber language?
5895560,eng,I have said that to you because I love you.
8297001,eng,I wish that you could tell me what I should do.
6676183,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary have both already left Boston.
7395605,eng,He says he won't have to do that.
6123222,eng,Do you think I should allow Tom to do that?
10126174,eng,Algeria's economy is slowing.
8407304,eng,Are you guys Canadians?
10317858,eng,Tom became a Baha'i.
6394424,eng,We're celebrating Layla's pregnancy.
4498555,eng,I felt very helpless.
5936363,eng,We're going to invite Tom and Mary to visit us next summer.
2642606,eng,Tom said Mary was a good pilot.
7924745,eng,Our government doesn't care about us.
6126840,eng,Tom just kept running.
8865242,eng,I don't like it a bit.
6089478,eng,If this damn parrot doesn't stop screaming now I'll break its neck.
7511281,eng,Tom told everybody that he needed to do that.
6248745,eng,I assume you'd be willing to do that.
7506667,eng,I know that Tom knows that we don't have to do that.
8578893,eng,He's an Algerian environmentalist.
9802930,eng,Tungsten is a chemical element with the symbol W.
10040004,eng,I've been saying it for many years!
4486439,eng,How exactly am I supposed to do that?
4529884,eng,I appreciate what Tom said.
7380319,eng,Mary is really good at her job.
4141168,eng,"Does anyone know what has caused this plague? ""The scholars of the University of Paris believe that the source of this evil is an especially unfavorable constellation of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars."""
9265585,eng,"Oh, you're already here."
3818766,eng,I wouldn't have waited.
7736107,eng,The engine is making strange noises.
10660433,eng,Time is fleeting.
6417354,eng,I should tell Mary why Tom doesn't like her.
10176113,eng,Tom didn't call us like he was supposed to.
6492767,eng,Tom and Mary would've done that by now if they were really planning to do it.
1018186,eng,"The most important Shinto event takes place in the New Year, when millions of people visit shrines to pray for happiness and a healthy year."
7392941,eng,He said that he couldn't swim well.
9810870,eng,"As long as they're still negotiating, there's still hope."
9299890,eng,I met Tom twice this year.
1602279,eng,Elephants trumpet when they are scared and when they are angry.
8612600,eng,"Noureddine Khettal, the separatist, drives an electric car."
6242271,eng,Tom says he's been asked to give a speech.
2549207,eng,We were very sad.
3914841,eng,You're supposed to be helping them.
2249304,eng,It's terribly important.
7516803,eng,I didn't know that I had hurt anybody.
7792235,eng,Why couldn't we survive on Mars?
5366387,eng,Do you not remember what you said anymore?
9705480,eng,It's a miracle you're alive.
1392528,eng,I don't care as long as you're happy.
5269337,eng,Two trains collided in Southern Italy.
6495721,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary would be absent if they weren't sick.
10339750,eng,It's a Great Dane.
3010887,eng,I'm having sex with you.
10545917,eng,Did she come?
10160058,eng,Please leave the door open on your way out.
6429770,eng,Mary raised her voice.
9696596,eng,Let me know when you'll come back home.
1681885,eng,I cannot be absent. I'm the manager.
5471311,eng,It smells bad in here.
8241209,eng,You've been too rough on us.
2380395,eng,I made a promise.
7388806,eng,He's back in his hometown.
1923441,eng,I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
2360834,eng,I heard you were sick.
2240803,eng,We're being paranoid.
7199560,eng,You promised that you'd stay.
7448920,eng,Tom was in high spirits.
9999937,eng,Mary is a very nice lady.
4497372,eng,"I'm not going to do anything about that, at least not tonight."
8306392,eng,"A new report by 11,258 scientists in 153 countries from a broad range of disciplines warns that the planet “clearly and unequivocally faces a climate emergency,” and provides six broad policy goals that must be met to address it."
45808,eng,I can't make head or tail of those directions.
2663120,eng,Do you think Tom has a drug problem?
6085543,eng,Could you tell me what happened to Tom?
6415347,eng,Mary says she doesn't know what Tom should do.
7442013,eng,They weren't wearing their wedding rings.
5780451,eng,Promise me you'll sing.
277888,eng,The town was destroyed by the flood after the storm.
8219110,eng,It's you she's interested in.
10713704,eng,I have but seven aeroplanes.
3991393,eng,Dan was accused of committing a murder.
7137528,eng,Sami doesn't know anything.
7270990,eng,Sami knew exactly what happened in that room.
7735218,eng,You know you're not supposed to be here.
1891110,eng,I'm ready.
296889,eng,"Last night, he studied all night long."
2986315,eng,Tom wasn't expecting to see Mary at the party.
7399738,eng,She said that she was intrigued.
10019076,eng,A large animal has escaped from the zoo.
10687657,eng,Which movie did you like better?
6869428,eng,Tom is the only person who should have done that.
1725915,eng,I knew that he was reading.
6229786,eng,Tom has been accused of setting fire to one of his own buildings.
8625052,eng,Mary is touchy-feely.
6698271,eng,It is the best fish and seafood restaurant in the city.
2617250,eng,Water is the essence of life.
6432890,eng,Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't win.
4133501,eng,I forgot to tell you where the party is.
6512902,eng,"Tom and Mary really like swimming, don't they?"
5109153,eng,"Why do you say these things, friend?"
2953884,eng,We're about to go out for something to eat.
4663407,eng,Tom watches TV every evening after dinner.
5744377,eng,This bill is unnecessary.
1709289,eng,You bake in your kitchen.
8763965,eng,He was just sitting at the desk behind a loaded pistol and staring with empty eyes.
3905558,eng,I told them not to tell anyone.
4663030,eng,"Tom could tell us what needs to be done, I think."
7385767,eng,He probably dyes his hair.
7863077,eng,Algeria is relatively economically stable.
9458502,eng,We both got A's on the test.
6507536,eng,Tom and Mary weren't doing that the right way.
9468857,eng,I don't think anybody else noticed you crying.
1887780,eng,I think we should start making plans for the summer.
7208147,eng,That isn't something that I can do.
1224264,eng,"Her car might be more pleasant to drive, but it also costs her more for maintenance."
5275110,eng,They like to play on the swings in the park.
1682452,eng,I cannot go to the stadium by myself.
6560198,eng,Sami was indicted for first degree murder.
3743716,eng,"Why are you wet? ""I fell in the water."""
8083417,eng,"No hands shall touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or he shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, he shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them go up into the mount."
7503003,eng,I knew that Tom was better at playing the trombone than Mary.
3723301,eng,I was asked to wear a wire.
6604254,eng,Sit quietly and watch for a few minutes.
7404051,eng,He says he's not worried.
7153198,eng,I've always liked football.
10186319,eng,Yanni was carrying a ladder.
7186022,eng,I'm sorry that I left without you.
70456,eng,It has not yet been decided whether to approve of your proposal.
8584696,eng,I'm sure that the culprit is Tom.
1573984,eng,My intervention on your behalf is the only reason you still have a job.
7813048,eng,You should get to the station as close as possible to five o'clock.
6781547,eng,I'm not a pacifist.
280579,eng,Why don't you strike out on your own?
10784511,eng,We heard one of the dogs barking.
851937,eng,Aren’t they going to the ceilidh in the town?
3824293,eng,It could've been a gun.
3605541,eng,Tom doesn't have the answer to Mary's question.
7493594,eng,Tom said he isn't sure if Mary can swim.
9694127,eng,Did you understand what Tom was saying?
10544668,eng,Tom worked on an equal footing with everyone.
6520228,eng,Tom and Mary are based in Boston.
10296861,eng,Ziri has got to be careful.
1492902,eng,Carrots cost three dollars.
8161091,eng,Your best friend is the money in your pocket.
6500504,eng,All Tom and Mary wanted was for John to leave them alone.
4717298,eng,"Who is in the car? ""Marija."""
9971309,eng,Why don't we leave at 2:30?
8290945,eng,He pitched overboard.
8511906,eng,I hope that you know what you're doing.
2955855,eng,Tom and Mary were both wearing rubber gloves.
6490538,eng,Tom and Mary said they haven't talked to John about that yet.
8056354,eng,Can you recommend a good hotel in Kabylie?
7934051,eng,He has nobody to take care of him.
391085,eng,She idled away many hours on the beach.
35635,eng,The party was put off for a week.
10267295,eng,We are doing great.
2863759,eng,I want a golden cross.
10677450,eng,There's enough food to go around.
2694568,eng,I'll be calling you every morning.
10522366,eng,The smell of petrichor reminds me of my aunt.
6812140,eng,I think Tom is getting better.
6212392,eng,"Two he-goats, belonging to his herd, were jealous of one another, and at last engaged in fight, butting at each other so violently that one of them had a horn broken, and ran away in great pain, bellowing loudly."
887368,eng,She saw him driving his new car.
7387099,eng,He came with his father.
257812,eng,I went to see the baseball game yesterday.
7070771,eng,The supervisor was there to evaluate my teacher.
6353484,eng,Why can't you just do that?
7400165,eng,He knows he has to be patient.
22159,eng,The pirates had no choice but to surrender.
3415292,eng,Have you ever dreamed about me?
9999326,eng,Tom is a boy from Australia.
8792187,eng,Nuja and Mira were pleased to see Skura.
3131620,eng,What happened was unavoidable.
9183219,eng,I haven't thought about it yet.
297684,eng,He gave me a piece of advice.
2013669,eng,Tom wants your parking space.
297298,eng,He wouldn't permit me to swim in the river.
2650042,eng,It's a crime against nature.
6838567,eng,I know that Tom was last.
4012662,eng,Someone could get hurt doing this.
9393340,eng,That green stuff on your face makes you look like an ogre.
328377,eng,Last week's snow was limited to a very small area.
283732,eng,He's charging me roughly four times as much as he charged when he started cutting my lawn.
6425732,eng,Do you think Mary killed herself?
2261877,eng,Give Tom a tissue.
7869217,eng,"He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me."
298035,eng,He is junior to me by two years.
7405621,eng,She says she can't win.
6728487,eng,I did that while everyone else was still sleeping.
8536527,eng,He enjoyed himself at the dance last weekend.
8988391,eng,Let's see if Tom already has one.
6920741,eng,I think you and I can help each other.
8438340,eng,I wonder why the bus is almost empty today.
8998679,eng,Our parents adore us.
2549114,eng,I'll come at once.
6525274,eng,Both Tom and Mary have seen that movie.
6116125,eng,"People always find a reason to be unhappy, no matter how good their life may be."
2773820,eng,We were absent.
6810835,eng,Sami is Arab himself.
5927353,eng,I don't see anything wrong with zoos.
2713485,eng,I'm the same age as Tom.
5850576,eng,I hate homework.
4664855,eng,I think Tom has already seen it.
6898492,eng,"Tom is huge, isn't he?"
54679,eng,We should do away with this regulation.
6661515,eng,Tom got here on foot.
3723145,eng,It's important to look at the big picture here.
7502472,eng,I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't have to do that.
7394060,eng,She thought she could do that again.
4828795,eng,My feet are smaller than your feet.
45975,eng,The math homework proved to be easier than I had expected.
7509093,eng,It smells like someone has been smoking in here.
307358,eng,They inquired about his past experience.
10221925,eng,Ziri was under arrest.
6224015,eng,Tom said he plans on staying in Boston.
6245325,eng,Tom said he'd do that as soon as he can.
10079917,eng,Who are you to tell me what I need to do?
6228160,eng,I didn't know what time I was supposed to meet Tom at the airport.
6221236,eng,Tom may be retired by now.
6435098,eng,I told Tom the same thing Mary told him.
10128844,eng,I know you're not going to listen and that you'll make a mistake again.
4186054,eng,She always sees beauty in the little things.
3913375,eng,Tom won't let them in.
7924206,eng,He wants to know everything.
6759917,eng,I wasn't surprised when Tom told me Mary had to do that.
264421,eng,I prefer to work on my own.
323268,eng,I'm afraid it may rain tomorrow.
10277873,eng,"Calcium, heated with a Bunsen burner, turns the flame orange-red."
7990072,eng,Sami was a child.
10109746,eng,Algeria has many demographic gifts.
1040563,eng,Tom scarfed down the ham sandwich that Mary had made for him.
10579581,eng,"What the hell is this? ""Fuck if I know."""
3732686,eng,Everyone's out in the back yard.
6428210,eng,Mary lives with her parents.
2956636,eng,Tom doesn't fear death.
7205642,eng,I need to be in Boston by the first of next month.
9086287,eng,Tom works as a tiler for a building firm.
8380756,eng,Tom is the one who taught Mary to swim.
5639088,eng,Everyone wanted Tom to have fun.
314228,eng,She gave me a doll.
7398137,eng,She told me that she was wealthy.
7859906,eng,France and Algeria need each other.
839890,eng,We're having a barbecue.
6336610,eng,I wonder whether Tom really has a driver's license.
4153417,eng,He's quite an unpleasant fellow!
7773822,eng,Where is your package?
3910845,eng,I recommended him.
6235190,eng,"You don't want Tom to do that anymore, do you?"
942833,eng,"That knife wasn't sharp and I couldn't cut the meat with it, so I resorted to using my pocket knife."
7961715,eng,I told her to shut the fuck up.
6418209,eng,Did Mary know what she was doing was wrong?
2549592,eng,We have a pool.
6976441,eng,"What do you think of my theory? ""It is all surmise."""
1662220,eng,Tom is calling back.
1329663,eng,I found out the cause of my death.
6506201,eng,Tom and Mary say they'll play golf even if it rains.
8906185,eng,"Estimates are that over 300,000 people were killed and some 1.5 million left homeless."
7407203,eng,They bullied their classmates.
6650633,eng,Tom said that he'd sign the contract.
5729567,eng,Tom had to find Mary very quickly.
10781032,eng,A powerful cyclone paralyzed Europe.
10338220,eng,It was a taste of freedom.
8826711,eng,His furrowed brow suggested lingering doubts.
8194481,eng,"This Kabyle dress is a gift. ""For whom?"""
6226720,eng,Tom said that isn't the only reason Mary wanted to do that.
9723282,eng,I am very sorry about that.
8554138,eng,Tom didn't sing the song that we requested.
8577878,eng,"The actions are part of a larger movement to get insurance companies, large investors and governments to end fossil fuel investments."
1178782,eng,Allow me to contradict you.
3310272,eng,We've all been here before.
7384076,eng,She only had three dollars with her.
8498433,eng,Tom isn't composing.
264938,eng,We hurried to make up for the lost time.
8969718,eng,Tom ate like a horse.
8651457,eng,She saw someone.
7506210,eng,I know Tom doesn't want to do that until after lunch.
3519319,eng,Take a look around you.
6979829,eng,I'll just take the check. Thanks!
5758086,eng,Tom scored twice.
1729946,eng,Cut off the gas!
8389584,eng,I am learning Thai.
4529457,eng,My name was omitted from the list.
286722,eng,What is his business?

1676644,eng,Tom attended an all-boys school.
3168446,eng,Let's continue from where we left off yesterday.
6440121,eng,Have you found your key?
2673628,eng,They can overcome their fears.
8634307,eng,Tom has PTSD from working as a firefighter.
4931482,eng,I should have known.
6268902,eng,Tom found Mary's purse under the sofa.
7174156,eng,I thought that I ought to offer Tom some help.
27966,eng,The doctor advised me to stop smoking.
2116695,eng,Poor guy... Food poisoning's never fun.
9193183,eng,I'm going to do things my way.
8786477,eng,A racist state can't possibly be democratic.
1204702,eng,Tom came on Monday and went back home the following day.
10108042,eng,Yanni appreciates everything Rima did for him.
2099999,eng,And what if your son was like that?
10023520,eng,Yanni hates muffins.
8817877,eng,"I know Tom, too."
698831,eng,A language is a key to the heart of millions.
47797,eng,The treasure lay hidden for a long time.
6662894,eng,Is Tom better today?
1497677,eng,We must strive to do better.
10169550,eng,Yanni learned to speak Berber in just a few weeks.
8855676,eng,Those who wake others with their snoring must sleep outside.
9707740,eng,What did you guys do yesterday?
6248368,eng,Tom should've stayed in Boston longer.
18900,eng,"To my surprise, they ate the meat raw."
9821378,eng,Yanni needs more room.
396152,eng,This just has to be his umbrella.
6346290,eng,Tom wouldn't tell me how to do that.
64942,eng,It is mean of him to deceive an elderly lady.
7438882,eng,They said that they'll help us do that.
7444749,eng,They told me that they were free.
2299520,eng,I asked Tom to describe it.
3907512,eng,I'm closer to him than anyone.
7383628,eng,He blamed himself.
4211700,eng,Tom woke up to watch the sunrise.
9331170,eng,Thank you for lending the book to us.
5241999,eng,I'm not a tattletale.
10235722,eng,Ziri argued with Rima's secretary.
8905457,eng,GDP growth turned positive in 2017 as oil prices recovered and output stabilized.
2643265,eng,Tom doesn't look tired to me.
6416147,eng,Mary said that she was going to be very late.
3148349,eng,There's really no reason for you to come to Boston.
8519701,eng,He sat down on the couch next to her.
5736482,eng,The conditions are terrible.
2107533,eng,Tom's helping.
6457945,eng,I do not want you for your cooking only.
9804245,eng,Yanni is so excited.
9696242,eng,I know that I have to do that. I just don't want to.
8405305,eng,All of my brothers still live in Boston.
6344857,eng,I knew Tom wouldn't try to do that.
8767207,eng,"Across the U.S., artisanal and specialty cheesemakers are facing devastating business losses."
6248718,eng,I definitely won't forget to do that.
3727986,eng,There's no getting over that.
274148,eng,He is well advanced in life.
3413097,eng,You need to get back to the office.
3922935,eng,We have an incredible North Atlantic salmon.
2548332,eng,I'll do what I want.
8585179,eng,"SuperCam fires a pulsed laser beam out of the rover's mast, or ""head,"" to vaporize small portions of rock from a distance, providing information that will be essential to the mission's success."
10108041,eng,"Be polite, Yanni."
1111462,eng,"When the tempura I make cools down, it immediately loses its crispiness and doesn't taste very good."
6803323,eng,I did my best to help Tom.
6091263,eng,Tom bit his lower lip.
8202049,eng,I'm still near your house.
5761679,eng,"As my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you."
4497398,eng,I probably would've done the same thing that Tom did.
5892531,eng,Revenge has consequences.
3053019,eng,Language itself shapes a man's basic ideas.
8378286,eng,Tom is nice to Mary and her friends.
6315802,eng,"You call it thirst for adventure, and I call it irresponsibility."
4490826,eng,Sometimes you don't need to speak the same language in order to understand each other.
7175397,eng,Tom thought that Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
5744182,eng,What are you involved in?
29807,eng,My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
7474362,eng,They're not doing the best they can.
2730472,eng,I love twilight.
9295191,eng,We were all deceived by Tom.
6652699,eng,Tom said he thought that it was time for him to retire.
6203052,eng,Comedy too can sometimes discern what is right.
6539387,eng,Sami didn't have sex with his victims.
9086522,eng,Yanni asked Skura where she was from and she told him she was from Algeria.
8516412,eng,He stopped and stared at her.
8100143,eng,Mary tried to look casual.
6604342,eng,"Some seabirds, like albatrosses, and storm-petrels, remain far out at sea where they feed and rest, coming ashore only to breed."
6825719,eng,Tom said he didn't intend to go to Boston.
5876351,eng,Everybody in the community loved Fadil.
6266780,eng,Tom has plans to visit Boston.
6898090,eng,"You're not telling me the whole truth, are you?"
10457507,eng,Tests make most students nervous.
7114296,eng,Why is Tom confident?
5731787,eng,What happened to that project?
9972737,eng,The mother is carrying a child in her arms.
323596,eng,Look at the bird singing in the tree.
8514802,eng,She always did her best to help him.
10021900,eng,We put on our boots.
4666310,eng,We still need to compete.
8877866,eng,It'll probably rain after lunch.
9682125,eng,Tom looks younger now that he's shaved off his mustache.
1633595,eng,Why don't you come to the party with us?
7735008,eng,I believe that might be the best solution.
8915691,eng,Tom was bothering me.
7177732,eng,Tom said that Mary told him to do that.
5132174,eng,That's what we're working towards.
5748158,eng,Where would Tom fit in?
7388368,eng,He's made his position clear.
313743,eng,She is giving a party tonight.
6231433,eng,I wasn't the one who told Tom he shouldn't do that.
821004,eng,Let's sit down on this bench.
6570559,eng,Visualize your entire body.
6451423,eng,Sami refused to do so.
5871877,eng,Fadil worked hard to make sure Layla had everything she needed.
6125303,eng,I don't think Tom enjoys swimming.
9192830,eng,Today is my day off.
5215498,eng,We’re empowering the next generation of women by investing in adolescent girls and advancing the Let Girls Learn initiative to get 62 million girls into schools.
3039985,eng,Only through art can we emerge from ourselves and know what another person sees.
1147565,eng,She speaks too much.
9568685,eng,This is a nutcracker.
9999377,eng,I'm losing money.
8394900,eng,You need to speak from the heart.
9506479,eng,Algeria needs a strong government.
286775,eng,"His condition is if only, better than in the morning."
9671500,eng,Yanni was flying into trouble.
4520298,eng,Tom's matured a fair bit in the last few years.
7378341,eng,"Mary is feeling OK now, isn't she?"
6250158,eng,Tom and I don't go to the same school.
3163406,eng,I never thought that he could be sick.
2953341,eng,The delay was unavoidable.
6661974,eng,Tom and I weren't the only ones who didn't get enough to eat.
1531130,eng,What a superficial answer!
10455415,eng,The first song on the mix tape she made him was Multifoiled by Cocteau Twins.
32275,eng,Chicken pox is an itchy nuisance for kids.
924148,eng,I'm really bad at parallel parking.
7176058,eng,Tom thinks that it's embarrassing.
5648475,eng,I do think it's wrong of her.
6125592,eng,Tom's problems began soon after Mary left.
69808,eng,What do you study a foreign language for?
8208511,eng,Can you speak French and English?
9448004,eng,What Bersani says seems reasonable to me.
6274405,eng,Tom was a bit drunk.
10091542,eng,A cat skulked round the corner.
7171490,eng,I thought that you might be able to give me a hand.
24994,eng,What's my book doing here?
2406518,eng,I shouldn't really be here.
38145,eng,I have no idea where I left my keys.
4666874,eng,Tom is doing it wrong.
289350,eng,He is above telling lies.
10331944,eng,Tunisia appealed to Algeria for assistance.
9704995,eng,Don't twist my words.
40597,eng,I should say he won't come.
6264372,eng,I think Tom could help Mary if he wanted to.
5592868,eng,Are you having any difficulty swallowing?
7286465,eng,Sami was fully convinced that his room was haunted.
5065865,eng,Tom and Mary are playing Minecraft together.
1869018,eng,He is talking on the phone.
6810362,eng,I'm confident I can pass tomorrow's French test.
7978359,eng,I'll never forget the day that we first met.
4013097,eng,This isn't a good place to pitch a tent.
8043343,eng,We don't have any more paint.
10455636,eng,Learning Physics is not easy.
8403809,eng,His wife is sexier.
46079,eng,The newspaper has a large circulation.
6512295,eng,Tom and Mary wondered why they'd been invited.
6165291,eng,I use this expression very rarely.
3226411,eng,"Alone, he did the work of ten men."
10141262,eng,We put on our helmets.
239584,eng,The most severe problem at present is that of over-population.
6898056,eng,"You aren't really planning to take pictures, are you?"
6346971,eng,I thought Tom probably did that.
430202,eng,The station is located between these two towns.
8509286,eng,It won't just happen. You have to make it happen.
6491931,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary know they aren't supposed to do that.
286282,eng,I can hardly stand his behavior.
3222646,eng,Now is the winter of our discontent.
6709388,eng,Sami and Layla shared the same room.
2245651,eng,I canceled it.
3823734,eng,This picture is horrible.
8908773,eng,Were you and Tom close?
5271637,eng,Our condom broke.
7474147,eng,They say that they aren't happy here.
6435055,eng,There's a supermarket on the next block.
3903989,eng,I have to deal with them.
271940,eng,I estimate the production costs to be 36 percent of the budget.
7168734,eng,I think that Tom is likely to be late.
6412309,eng,Mary didn't know that what she was doing was wrong.
6415797,eng,"If you see Mary, tell her I'm looking for her."
4500175,eng,I was in shock.
6922594,eng,Tom sent a bouquet of flowers to his mother on Mother's Day.
3183894,eng,I think Tom is timid.
8183996,eng,You're the only person that can help me do that.
1029871,eng,Tom and Mary couldn't go on a picnic because it was raining.
5927094,eng,It's a Germanic name.
5909805,eng,We don't have permission to do that.
2576496,eng,We are candid.
7240895,eng,I didn't know that you were married to each other.
10212845,eng,Ziri has food in his basket.
9801032,eng,Yanni was distracted.
1475617,eng,I'm sure that he went to Tokyo.
284658,eng,He has no girlfriend.
2407913,eng,I think I'm OK.
7822949,eng,Why is it so difficult to master French?
2081911,eng,"Winter is the coldest season of the year. As proof, sometimes it snows."
1712954,eng,We bought a new washing machine.
10538594,eng,Mary is expecting twins.
3078750,eng,I've decided to quit working here.
6259399,eng,I didn't go shopping yesterday.
2957940,eng,Tom reminded us to do our homework.
66747,eng,A good brandy completes a fine meal.
6491209,eng,Tom and Mary are going to keep doing that until someone tells them that they can't.
5152919,eng,They see it.
7508435,eng,I want you to know that I'll never do that again.
7509969,eng,I know that Tom isn't allergic to strawberries.
3156815,eng,Tom must've put up a fight.
8928519,eng,Tom won't sit here.
2961489,eng,The sauce needs more chili.
2547782,eng,I'm crazy about Mary.
5203240,eng,I don't sleep that much.
8567038,eng,They've been to Mexico.
273888,eng,Our grandparents would come to see us on the weekends.
37253,eng,Tom filled out the application form.
4756814,eng,Let's go to the zoo!
10665249,eng,"Mr Miller! Mr Miller! ""Yes, what is it, Taylor? I'm in a hurry."""
9296832,eng,One of the Toms is Egyptian.
10211178,eng,Ziri was hunted like an animal.
3605440,eng,At what time does it leave?
6702144,eng,Tom can hardly see anything without his glasses.
6577130,eng,Watch how he scrambles up the hillside.
3920051,eng,You'd have to ask him.
10126222,eng,I'm also a newbie.
2737516,eng,I used a knife to cut the cake.
7875954,eng,That's what my mom told me.
7752792,eng,I'll cut the cake and you'll choose what piece you want.
4999845,eng,I think they were surprised.
8938085,eng,I want to be Tom's roommate.
8554959,eng,He walks about ten kilometers a day.
6399612,eng,"Whatever brawls disturb the street, There should be peace at home: Where sisters dwell and brothers meet, Quarrels should never come."
812116,eng,Declarations of variables are extremely important in C and C++.
3157608,eng,Did you drink tea yesterday?
5838755,eng,Police spotted Fadil's car near the border.
3131618,eng,What happens if we get infected?
7977976,eng,Mum is playing tennis now.
7338118,eng,Sami is a sixteen year old freshman.
7760617,eng,"As they arose to leave the fountain which had been witness of their mutual engagement, an arrow whistled through the air, and struck a raven perched on the sere branch of an old oak, near to where they had been seated."
6817120,eng,She uses password protection on the hard drive.
7381586,eng,Mary punched her time card.
9814673,eng,Tom bought a watermelon.
7215172,eng,Sami doesn't want his mother to see his tattoo.
7473889,eng,They knew where they'd put their keys.
6254855,eng,Tom and I killed time playing cards.
6311280,eng,I'm willing to give anything for that look.
5850116,eng,Tom sold the farm after Mary died and went back to Boston.
6421027,eng,Mary knows that what she did was wrong.
6225099,eng,Tom said he'd try to do that again tomorrow.
7218415,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was a good cook.
8050486,eng,Mennad was looking at me sideways.
659585,eng,He is as nutty as a fruitcake.
10669936,eng,"To Buddhists, anger and hate are defilements."
2861755,eng,He warned us.
10167117,eng,Tom didn't try to defend Mary.
7191981,eng,I hear Tom really likes living in Australia.
10613344,eng,Don't make me beg you.
10568401,eng,How many times have you and Tom gone to Boston together?
593763,eng,A part-time job is convenient for housewives.
3259376,eng,Her oldest son is not married.
9970410,eng,"I can't hear you, Gabriel. Speak up."
7668023,eng,Do you know her favorite colors?
5991270,eng,"Where are you going? ""Anywhere that isn't here."""
8546345,eng,Tom looks like a wise man.
10095813,eng,Could you wash my clothes for me?
2912061,eng,How many other houses does Tom own?
7111995,eng,How long have you been in this job?
10132114,eng,Electricity and health care have improved in Algeria.
8612790,eng,What's the capital of Iraq?
6340318,eng,I think Tom is still determined to do that.
3444566,eng,Tom is in better shape than me.
6378400,eng,Sami was interested in horses.
2215638,eng,Tom will be overjoyed.
6797068,eng,Tom hasn't been replaced yet.
6347642,eng,Tom and I don't go dancing anymore.
8050072,eng,Mennad has an appoitment at six.
8568152,eng,He bought these souvenirs in Algeria.
10022983,eng,I think he can't help you.
6821874,eng,Do you really want us to do that?
296570,eng,He got up earlier than usual this morning.
7404339,eng,She looks like she's sorry.
9447705,eng,Tom is being manipulated by Mary.
3920551,eng,I'm slightly worried about you.
2489577,eng,I told Tom I had forgotten my password.
9804211,eng,Yanni is famous now.
8287361,eng,It hurts like hell.
3527229,eng,It's Tom's dream to live in the mountains.
8406426,eng,You must see it to believe.
6491795,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary are confused.
6661718,eng,I don't think your plan is feasible.
10066694,eng,The teachers are teaching again. The strike is over.
2483550,eng,They don't have enough room to camp.
7146356,eng,Sami will be up for the rest of the night.
4306394,eng,How do you expect me to pay for this?
7191434,eng,I ran into Tom last week in Australia.
6261938,eng,Where in Boston did you live?
4500491,eng,They all know this.
9012001,eng,The woman has two wallets.
6082579,eng,How much does this house cost?
320431,eng,What the lawyer had told me finally turned out to be false.
9971448,eng,I would like to become an astronaut.
9975363,eng,Yanni runs a home improvement store in Algiers.
6884224,eng,Tom knows that Mary will do that.
2249966,eng,Sit back down.
237649,eng,Do you get up at six?
9740888,eng,It took nearly three years to build that bridge.
680295,eng,They always give their attention to environmental problems.
269557,eng,The deep red of the setting sun portended fine weather.
2542698,eng,You're unusually quiet today.
456153,eng,It took me 2 hours to finish the essay.
6438311,eng,Tom does tend to be late a lot.
8904447,eng,I don't know who took my phone.
10539964,eng,I've never been spoken to by a foreigner before.
2290271,eng,I didn't ask for your opinion.
7121042,eng,Sami supports Layla.
2262055,eng,I've never underestimated Tom.
6322202,eng,"What's the time? - ""I don't have a watch."""
10699170,eng,Let's not forget the sacrifices that Tom has made.
10352295,eng,Look for signs of decomposition.
3476686,eng,Tom cried when I left.
4915738,eng,That's something I'll never forget.
262455,eng,Are there any messages for me?
5390540,eng,Tom was an Eagle Scout.
244545,eng,I had never talked with Cathy until yesterday.
10643448,eng,Is the water clear enough for snorkelling?
8122847,eng,Algeria will never respect human rights.
3161818,eng,Tom said that he'd help me.
308244,eng,It is quite natural for her to be angry with you.
5468818,eng,I had lunch at a bakery.
10148416,eng,What will Yanni do with the money?
7155272,eng,Why don't you visit me next time you're in Australia?
10193098,eng,"To cope with her depression, Mary threw herself into her work."
10654877,eng,I think we need to buy tickets.
7356910,eng,I would never have guessed.
1306416,eng,The cookies are under the table.
1520624,eng,He would make everyone happy.
7240573,eng,I know it's there.
2541871,eng,I'm in no position to help you.
6203076,eng,All I know is that I know nothing.
2259311,eng,The enemy suffered many casualties.
54351,eng,Make contact when it is convenient.
2663017,eng,Have you been having problems with Tom?
10554169,eng,Logic isn't a list of fallacies.
6271294,eng,I know Tom won't help Mary do that.
2265699,eng,I think you should stop smoking.
9949929,eng,Yanni came up to Skura's table.
8599178,eng,We used to have more students here.
8777505,eng,The bags are filled to the brim.
7856791,eng,Who would not like to visit Algeria?
8451938,eng,He suggested another plan to the committee.
1331866,eng,This student put all others to shame by his industriousness.
5876335,eng,The situation was dire.
8529853,eng,My towels are fresh-smelling and absorbent.
8411551,eng,The imam was like a big brother to me.
6357307,eng,Tom told me he'd win.
7015987,eng,You are not pregnant.
5350251,eng,Mary admitted that she had been secretly going out with Tom.
3887644,eng,I just want us to be together.
9585308,eng,Relax your body.
9775921,eng,"In most cases, that won't happen."
7130980,eng,Tom is likely to be unfazed by that.
3731938,eng,Does Tom scare you?
4398150,eng,That's a reasonable thing to do.
5737208,eng,I really didn't even notice.
6647270,eng,Tom told everybody he'd decided to do that.
6233055,eng,I think we could do that without making any noise.
271152,eng,The world is changing more and more quickly.
8007910,eng,Mennad returned to Cairo.
51977,eng,"When we arrived at the stadium, the game had already started."
2210715,eng,Why don't you go find someone else who needs your help?
9432560,eng,I hope that Tom is safe.
10736212,eng,Tom couldn't swim when he was a kid.
242893,eng,It's rather cold today.
7270264,eng,Richard Dawkins is a famous atheist.
5853292,eng,I'll assist Tom.
6658589,eng,I don't have any objection to your leaving.
10317219,eng,He who is afraid of the inevitable can in no way live with his soul at peace.
7465548,eng,He is sowing discord.
6273645,eng,Tom studied French with Mary.
2272755,eng,Tom is a baby.
7189988,eng,I figured that you'd be impressed.
6250310,eng,I gave Tom all the money I had.
291790,eng,He achieved his aim at last.
413025,eng,"Even with all his wealth and fame, he's unhappy."
6493453,eng,You should probably tell Tom and Mary why they shouldn't be doing that.
68283,eng,That president's secretary is always prim.
10118045,eng,Tom sent Mary a Valentine's Day card.
6114519,eng,Sami immediately fell in love with Layla.
8247710,eng,He met his wife in Algeria.
288497,eng,He has made the same mistake twice.
8535788,eng,He didn't take anything for himself.
2046846,eng,You always seem to be very busy.
51985,eng,Sparrows were flying about.
316114,eng,She has a cat. The cat is white.
8069247,eng,Tom isn't a successful businessman.
7405825,eng,He said he did that.
5378982,eng,Do you really think she'd go out with me?
8294537,eng,Y'all are worthless.
6522199,eng,What are Tom and Mary buying?
6407493,eng,Mary was mad at me because I wouldn't do what she asked me to do.
3824990,eng,"I couldn't believe it, either."
5462948,eng,We don't do it very often.
8264578,eng,I suggest that you get some sleep.
2315191,eng,I don't believe a word Tom said.
9830165,eng,"If you park your car here, it'll get towed away."
3825486,eng,Can cats really see in the dark?
9089621,eng,Yanni brought the pizzas to the kitchen.
247789,eng,We learned that oil floats on water.
10127889,eng,That isn't where I need to go.
3424059,eng,Tom has a thirty percent interest in the company.
1923416,eng,Tom died of a single gunshot wound.
267301,eng,She wanted to know if the photographer could remove the hat from the picture.
6651930,eng,Tom said that he was forced to do that.
3419676,eng,Tom grabbed Mary by the arm.
4284593,eng,I have good reasons for hating Tom.
6689627,eng,Sami was found dead in the underground parking.
10755611,eng,You're close to the truth.
10553686,eng,Haggling does not obligate you to buy.
1304529,eng,What's the best way to travel?
2539689,eng,It looked like Tom was about to cry.
9530638,eng,Thanks for pointing out the difference.
3521823,eng,Do you really trust Tom?
9004264,eng,It pains me to believe that.
10002940,eng,Turkey is the closest friend of Albania.
2542903,eng,I'm sure that was the reason.
314256,eng,She showed me his album.
255703,eng,I prefer you to come.
1601588,eng,Hello? Are you still there?
2007749,eng,Let's just end this.
7129929,eng,Tom doesn't seem to be as secretive as Mary seems to be.
8054238,eng,Mennad is a thief.
6247105,eng,Tom is the only one here with red hair.
9733567,eng,"I think I saw a ghost there. ""It wasn't a ghost. It was Yanni sitting alone in the dark."""
8066735,eng,I'd like to eat some ice cream.
9551069,eng,He had something else in mind.
2912854,eng,Thanks for your explanation. It helps to understand the sentence correctly.
36642,eng,Any child could do that.
3168475,eng,Tom asked why you had spent time in prison.
8991715,eng,I could tell by the look on Tom's face that he knew what was going on.
9499106,eng,The constant arguments sapped her energy.
9115034,eng,Yanni was eventually arrested.
7168158,eng,I think that Tom didn't do that last week.
3582252,eng,What about going out for a drink this evening?
6868403,eng,You should have warned me sooner.
8904573,eng,Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry.
9819204,eng,I might not feel like doing that tomorrow.
10769143,eng,I'll love you till I die.
6713135,eng,Open the oven.
595793,eng,"If you hit a patch of fog, slow down and put your blinkers on."
10243615,eng,Rima is a loyal girl.
2547770,eng,I'm glad I was wrong.
10219743,eng,You probably pay no attention to the likes of me?
6912338,eng,Tom and Mary are unhappy.
4125753,eng,Mahmud abhors being idle.
6239966,eng,Tom said he did that as quickly as he could.
8085909,eng,He wants to leave now.
1656518,eng,"If you can't read, it's not my fault."
8018307,eng,Do you know Cairo?
4497846,eng,What exactly did we miss?
5836020,eng,You can wake me up with a nice kiss.
8585062,eng,Tom apparently misused his position.
6927373,eng,I'm now living on Park Street.
6043401,eng,Layla got involved with Sami sexually.
8238439,eng,Explain to me why you don't want to go anymore.
3728475,eng,Tom said you knew about it.
7243520,eng,Sami asked for his money back.
10593934,eng,Tom puts ketchup on everything.
10017154,eng,Help us to rescue Tom.
6235859,eng,"You don't really feel like doing that, do you?"
3732762,eng,Tom won't know the difference.
8972632,eng,I get along with my coworkers.
6823407,eng,The problem is that everybody is too scared to talk to Tom.
8007445,eng,Nothing felt real.
2256402,eng,"I appeared on television once, but nobody believes me."
7217700,eng,I'm afraid you didn't understand me correctly. I don't want to be alone with you. I just want to be alone.
9837148,eng,A book is a kind of friend.
6443942,eng,Go get 'em tiger!
6078393,eng,"We are Russians, and you?"
9992683,eng,Yanni has a food truck in Algiers.
9722249,eng,"If you knock on the coffin, you will wake the dead."
6948421,eng,"Out of the two, I choose the least expensive."
7841655,eng,I am a Spanish citizen.
1024075,eng,Tom took his wallet out of his pocket.
2210761,eng,Why don't you help Tom with that?
7218739,eng,Mary told me that she was pregnant.
6430773,eng,I'm sure both Tom and Mary have to do that.
323138,eng,It's hard to predict what the weather will be like tomorrow.
8679885,eng,He was enjoying his life in Algeria.
6823420,eng,I don't think that Tom and Mary are so strange.
7228474,eng,I don't think that Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
6173579,eng,Sami and Layla are still together.
5711582,eng,This is the starting point.
7198273,eng,It isn't fake.
7791655,eng,I can't stand people who brag.
8092951,eng,There are people.
6658067,eng,Tom and I were told three hours ago to do that.
7206290,eng,Sami is interested in you.
4401875,eng,He should have kept that secret.
7436472,eng,Tom and Mary said that they probably wouldn't win.
8166910,eng,Algeria needs to reform its infrastructure.
8526578,eng,"She's stubborn, isn't she?"
8403236,eng,These tickets were given to me by Tom.
3940265,eng,Tom turned on the speakerphone.
4463787,eng,Something is changing.
7519002,eng,I know Tom is a relative of yours.
5744134,eng,Tom knew Mary was pregnant.
4495376,eng,Can you elaborate a bit?
49419,eng,The music evokes memories of an earlier time.
3356070,eng,You've got to face your fears.
5828305,eng,"Thank you. ""It was a pleasure."""
7197410,eng,It's not something that I'm very good at.
283401,eng,"If he could speak English, I would employ him right away."
1935458,eng,He let us go.
7169341,eng,I think that Tom still lives on Park Street.
6349528,eng,I wonder if you need to do that.
5859430,eng,I'm still just a child.
6228134,eng,I can't go to Boston with you because I don't have enough money.
4935575,eng,Tom often hangs out with John and Mary.
9720343,eng,"When it rains, it rains for everyone."
3360231,eng,You've done a good job here.
3912316,eng,You'll meet her.
7183774,eng,I admit I've never actually been to Boston.
3310217,eng,We've got things to do.
7152627,eng,That's why I went to Australia.
5659082,eng,I'll look at it very carefully.
6272979,eng,You're a little pale.
6658764,eng,Tom has to act quickly.
3913789,eng,We can't just leave him.
9998765,eng,How do they manage to sleep so well?
6343535,eng,None of my children were born in Boston.
6236589,eng,I didn't know I no longer needed to help Tom.
7236564,eng,I suspect Tom doesn't want to do that again.
6117707,eng,Sami never left his room.
8529479,eng,"He's still a little angry, isn't he?"
3825083,eng,Do you need to lie down?
300076,eng,He wept over his misfortunes.
7732192,eng,Tom will probably do that on Monday.
8123304,eng,You must've been practicing.
7126104,eng,The bus stopped and everybody got out.
1360715,eng,She fumbled around in the darkness.
6257496,eng,Tom thinks Mary will be finished doing that by 2:30.
8405215,eng,The last time that I was in Boston was for just three days.
7964394,eng,What time did you arrive from Luanda?
42816,eng,That's too small to fit on your head.
8933012,eng,Tom won't get punished.
10623065,eng,A trickle of blood ran from her temple down her cheek.
8242997,eng,How lucky are you?
7401923,eng,He said that he was unhappy.
2387705,eng,I need to make sure your leg isn't broken.
6507727,eng,It's clear Tom and Mary aren't going anywhere.
6767494,eng,"If everyone exercised, doctors would be out of business in weeks."
1632219,eng,Why did you draw a face on the wall?
7543722,eng,Tom can only do that on Mondays.
6241520,eng,How many times a night does Tom do that?
312102,eng,It is said that she is the best tennis player in France.
7378247,eng,Mary is trying to find her father.
4523931,eng,Tom is on paternity leave.
10743160,eng,I haven't done much recently.
8169946,eng,Does silence actually exist in this universe?
5637371,eng,This is killing us.
7401598,eng,She told me that she was full.
16751,eng,"You are, so to speak, a fish out of water."
10515771,eng,You are a mouldering wreck.
7738885,eng,Layla ran away.
6353206,eng,Tom didn't have an umbrella.
1513131,eng,"After I did my homework, I played football with my friends."
8158980,eng,Berbers converted to Islam and abandoned a lot of their traditional practices.
9381041,eng,"Mindy, talk to Zara about Esperanto. ""Okay, I will."""
264658,eng,It is beyond my power to build my own house.
8777424,eng,Ali drank black tea.
10335123,eng,I was promoted to the junior varsity team.
6331945,eng,To be well-heeled means to be wealthy and well-to-do. Perhaps wearing nice shoes is where “well-heeled” comes from.
7992638,eng,Sami hit the freeway.
9086097,eng,That's not something that I can do right now.
7245815,eng,Sami was fighting with other people.
8551207,eng,Algeria needs technological development.
2548251,eng,I'm going to church.
9531842,eng,"In French, you must leave a space between the last word and the exclamation point or question mark."
6409735,eng,Mary lives all by herself in a small cabin in the woods.
6272440,eng,Tom told Mary that she was safe.
28948,eng,I know an American girl who speaks Japanese very well.
309473,eng,What will happen to her?
6049235,eng,Who else is in this club?
8250150,eng,He became a member of the Nation of Islam.
278548,eng,My brother is not yet in school.
10336032,eng,Tom hasn't activated his account yet.
6474785,eng,Sami's affair took me off guard.
2208724,eng,"Can I have a moment alone with Tom, please?"
10481549,eng,Felix doesn't speak French.
3536246,eng,"What can I do? ""Chop those carrots. And try not to cut off your fingers."""
3917439,eng,What does that mean for him?
10540477,eng,Tom is an expert at that.
298888,eng,He considered himself lucky.
2720527,eng,"What's that, a love square?"
7769322,eng,Tom lives in a town not far from Boston.
2541563,eng,I hope Tom will help me do this.
1989745,eng,You looked like you were enjoying yourself.
47800,eng,The property is mine.
7953958,eng,Tom found the source of the problem.
49677,eng,The devil destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
261301,eng,I guessed her to be 40.
1701452,eng,I'm going there. No one can stop me.
278501,eng,The garden is still in shadow.
5057488,eng,You met each other at the airport.
303319,eng,He is proud of his father being rich.
7393844,eng,She told me that she'd call me back.
1095903,eng,Tom arrived home soaking wet.
10115763,eng,Mary doesn't like to talk about her love life.
295387,eng,He was filled with wonder.
8181774,eng,"Students can use valid passports as identification, but carrying a passport all the time puts it at risk of being lost or stolen, which creates major problems for international students."
322916,eng,I'm seeing all the sights.
7388306,eng,She has only done half her homework.
10598368,eng,My dog came running after me.
477736,eng,Look how fast he runs!
6848970,eng,The snow's melted.
7240666,eng,I know that I should be in Boston now.
8417497,eng,"It's about you, not me."
1651134,eng,I'll play with you.
6944386,eng,I've already told you that I'm not the one who did that.
7159134,eng,I'll be living in Australia with my grandparents next year.
9799634,eng,"Tom doesn't have running water, so sometimes he comes over to our place to take a bath."
3725358,eng,Tom was in the room.
8184138,eng,Tom didn't realize that Mary had to help John.
6083675,eng,Tom said he doesn't want to invite Mary to his party.
8294649,eng,There was a faint smile on her face.
257530,eng,I just got here this morning.
283073,eng,See to it that he does not go there.
10119035,eng,"It's been a while since I last saw your face, Tom. Recently you've been looking gloomy all the time, so I was worried about you. ""Really? Sorry for making you worry."""
4663656,eng,I don't think I'd mind doing this again.
1559845,eng,Where should I pay?
6875930,eng,"Tom is kind to everybody, isn't he?"
4383790,eng,I developed an aversion toward seafood.
73591,eng,"You can get it at the courthouse, the clerk added."
5258632,eng,Tom admitted he used drugs.
238119,eng,The policeman whistled for the car to stop.
6810042,eng,Sami was right behind Layla.
6437196,eng,Why is Tom always so pessimistic?
6425281,eng,Mary said that she was exhausted.
7219760,eng,Sami wanted to be safe.
4500616,eng,That sounds like another lie.
4497258,eng,Tom was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2013.
7396100,eng,She said she plans on going Monday.
38173,eng,We haven't decided where to take a rest.
5543354,eng,We're trying our best to do it.
3738222,eng,What should I do until then?
983779,eng,This sentence has to be proofed.
8114909,eng,"In Kabylie we eat couscous, the iconic dish of kabylie."
5736508,eng,Tom wanted Mary to come over.
7383212,eng,She's injured herself.
9459054,eng,We Algerians are very similar to Italians. Never mess with us.
3595023,eng,I like my doorman.
2243383,eng,They were good.
5864247,eng,Maria scratches the head.
6173592,eng,Sami works at a meat packing plant.
9694390,eng,Don't drive that close to it.
7180406,eng,Tom said that he was glad that Mary was able to do that.
3307525,eng,All those things are true.
9098292,eng,We listened.
8529266,eng,"She's just being cautious, isn't she?"
7866232,eng,Algeria's financial industry is suffering.
8476780,eng,He barely ate.
5747807,eng,Tom has totally lost it.
2396032,eng,Don't you think it's risky?
6907543,eng,It's difficult to differentiate between twins.
7399425,eng,He told me he was unimpressed.
8519479,eng,She sent a birthday card to him.
3024049,eng,Park Street used to be a dirt road.
6655074,eng,Tom said that he didn't enjoy doing that.
3310166,eng,We've got a lot more work to do before we can go home.
2281826,eng,Who doesn't like the beach?
2611894,eng,I was at home all day yesterday.
6838521,eng,I know Tom was the first one to do that.
6657760,eng,I don't want to go skiing with Tom.
4496071,eng,You're lucky that my dog didn't bite you.
8243604,eng,"Since she won't go anymore, I won't either."
2376200,eng,I know Tom has been unhappy.
10744632,eng,My father will be on TV tonight.
10485370,eng,Tom gave up after his first try.
3594043,eng,That wouldn't help me.
8262414,eng,It's snowed a bit.
10266829,eng,He ran as an independent candidate.
256033,eng,I must send for the doctor.
6111556,eng,Layla could see somebody.
7386859,eng,He said that he found his keys.
67650,eng,I understand you're visiting from America.
42620,eng,That's quite meaningless.
6257739,eng,Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John why she did that.
6092654,eng,I don't care what the color of your skin is.
5573364,eng,Tom wished to be rich.
250980,eng,My sister isn't used to cooking.
2418226,eng,Tom said he never wanted to get married.
3737067,eng,I'm not going to tell Tom anything that he doesn't already know.
8377407,eng,Tom is afraid he might be expelled.
2276209,eng,I don't take it personally.
3281703,eng,Trying to fix this is a waste of time.
2549892,eng,Are you still hungry or have you had enough?
7298731,eng,I'm proud of what I've accomplished.
6411611,eng,"Mary never wanted to give up, but she had no choice."
7826681,eng,The victim has been transported to the hospital in serious condition.
2012462,eng,I want to hear everything.
2573722,eng,I know that you want me back.
1759511,eng,"At last, you are going to be a June bride."
2257407,eng,That's so stupid.

7129899,eng,Tom and I need each other more now than we ever did before.
10767042,eng,Shall we eat now?
6355879,eng,Tom didn't look nervous.
8035277,eng,Mennad saw them.
6656475,eng,I almost froze to death when I fell through the ice.
7232755,eng,I wanted to do something for Tom.
7841491,eng,"This is the Algerian flag, our flag."
7506945,eng,I didn't know that Tom knew why I needed to do that.
6739983,eng,Tom has written a book on that subject.
7267848,eng,Sami took a week off.
285038,eng,You had as well throw your money into the ditch as give it to him.
8781487,eng,"Christopher Columbus was from Genoa. ""You're an anti-Kabyle racist employed by the Algerian secret service!!! Columbus was Kabyle!!!"""
2472468,eng,They say he's gone for good.
6081478,eng,I suggest doing that.
48857,eng,The rock projected over us like a roof.
2020894,eng,It doesn't hurt at all.
6097673,eng,Do you think Tom and Mary will get married?
7736288,eng,All Tom ate was one slice of bread.
6266720,eng,Tom is a member of our church.
3917775,eng,What can you do for her?
10106819,eng,Blackbirds are songbirds common throughout Europe.
63630,eng,Canada abounds in timber.
7543411,eng,Tom sleeps in the master bedroom.
3826319,eng,This is really beautiful.
7361119,eng,Sami asked Layla to take her hijab off.
9687511,eng,Yanni couldn't find a job and turned to the bottle to ease his pain.
5852313,eng,I drank a shot.
31969,eng,Mary plays the piano.
6425377,eng,Mary said she didn't know French.
7209163,eng,Sami and Layla were chatting for a little bit.
3563780,eng,"Now, let's play some baseball."
7347375,eng,"Try watching a sunset, said Anne, her eyes full of pride and joy."
6560693,eng,I don't drink beer very often.
7146619,eng,Sami is at an insane asylum.
2346032,eng,He wiped her tears away.
1886323,eng,Are you really leaving work early today?
6237859,eng,I was lying to Tom when I said I'd do that.
9524925,eng,Tell us if you're not coming.
6786287,eng,You look very impatient.
8253100,eng,I translated it into Berber.
7286872,eng,Sami was staring at the girl standing in front of him.
10650513,eng,Don't talk to me before I've had my coffee.
9698850,eng,Johnson insists the problems will be ironed out.
8610595,eng,Algeria shouldn't become a dump for Europe's used fossil-fuel cars.
8332700,eng,I should've dealt with that myself.
7058485,eng,This is your brain on drugs.
3024001,eng,The judge asked the defendant if he knew the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie.
6055632,eng,"Between 622 and 750, the Islamic Caliphate conquered the entire Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and North Africa, reaching the Indus river to the east, the Iberian Peninsula to the west, and the Black, Caspian, and Aral seas to the north."
7136545,eng,I think that it was just an anomaly.
2250422,eng,Don't even bother coming.
1359537,eng,Pinocchio had a long nose.
3914838,eng,Shouldn't you be helping her?
2045457,eng,I would never dream of leaving you.
3171552,eng,Tom finally came up with a solution to the problem.
8050208,eng,Mennad is new here.
7241410,eng,Sami knows exactly what I am talking about.
8108549,eng,A fall would be fatal.
8318789,eng,How much does rye flour cost?
3723182,eng,You can't be down here.
10223766,eng,Ziri is driving his RV around the country.
10528826,eng,You can't walk around town naked.
7992190,eng,Sami is in competition.
8247702,eng,He has been to Algeria four times.
7505436,eng,Tom told everyone that he had been abducted by aliens.
3824201,eng,Will you please tell me what happened?
4700007,eng,What else did you say?
6174560,eng,Sami was honking.
1282023,eng,Many fear an uptick in the violence.
299249,eng,He likes to hunt.
3839942,eng,All that read this can read.
6490214,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't know why John is planning to do that.
5553286,eng,Tom will become a teacher.
4405042,eng,Invite him to come watch a movie.
5440603,eng,Tom is a devout Catholic.
8790520,eng,I suffer from depression.
2539160,eng,I'm sure you heard about what Tom did.
7861929,eng,"He speaks three languages, including Berber."
7236464,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary are skeptical about that.
4496300,eng,Take care of Tom for me.
8225637,eng,He has no idea what is going on.
6224324,eng,Both Tom and I'll be busy this afternoon.
279378,eng,I threw up my food.
2253273,eng,Do you think the pond is frozen hard enough to skate on?
5597143,eng,What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
1157266,eng,I gave up on the idea of buying a house.
2289028,eng,Don't you hang up on me.
255300,eng,I make up my mind to do the work however hard it might be.
10298187,eng,Cultural cringe is an internalized inferiority complex.
7111533,eng,I didn't think that you'd be amused by what was happening.
9238545,eng,Teach her to live without you.
318897,eng,I have been to the airport to see my father off.
9735641,eng,I didn't want things to end up like this.
7832860,eng,"And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau: two hundred she-goats, twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she-asses, and ten of their foals."
7228381,eng,I don't think that Tom would like living here.
8338679,eng,"Tom was telling the truth, I'm pretty sure."
1894532,eng,Let's not talk.
6885044,eng,I had fish for dinner last night.
35615,eng,Party games bring a party to life.
8014259,eng,I lost my adorable kitten a few weeks back.
10688704,eng,"You are just like that other man who thinks that he can rely on some other person's affections. Maybe, a cat is a better companion."
5937231,eng,I've actually never been to Boston.
2542266,eng,Tom became even more agitated.
2783772,eng,People physically assault you to steal your money.
802672,eng,They blamed him for failing to improve the economy.
264620,eng,You must do what seems right to you.
9735923,eng,Yanni squeezed himself into the horror genre and made lots of films.
3433934,eng,Tom's a high-flying wheeler-dealer who often negotiates deals worth millions of dollars.
9461899,eng,All the boys are playing.
10115498,eng,Tom's the captain of the team.
461196,eng,Do you know why she couldn't come?
6263593,eng,You're doing that very well.
7242810,eng,Sami and Layla go to the gym every Saturday.
4501994,eng,Everything seemed to work.
10196828,eng,"It's a good idea, but I think we can make it better."
6767484,eng,We're out of figs.
6493109,eng,"Tom and Mary always wanted to go to Boston, but they never had the chance."
3968217,eng,Is Mr. Smith an English teacher?
3378138,eng,"I am not too rich, too fat or too happy."
5754581,eng,Tom plans to do that.
7429214,eng,Tom felt prepared.
10718919,eng,I can't do it on my own.
10771848,eng,Ziri's brother was such a weirdo.
8311603,eng,They were evacuated by helicopter.
6454685,eng,We were concerned for the community.
3959817,eng,Perhaps we should do something about it.
1546071,eng,"That book, which I read last week, is great."
2329340,eng,I gave some of my old clothes to the Salvation Army.
6904373,eng,Do you plan on going again?
10023179,eng,Yanni dried the dishes.
7414211,eng,Then I heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened.
8514074,eng,He felt sympathy for her.
6451972,eng,My mother is fifty years old.
10794382,eng,Tom and I had a terrible fight.
2033673,eng,I want you to give a message to Tom.
9956653,eng,Why do you want to wear a back brace?
8610551,eng,I spoke with President Tebboune.
5178603,eng,Let's get rid of this junk.
2744366,eng,I expected Tom to win the race.
2940773,eng,I want the biggest cake.
3960887,eng,Some men wear jewelry.
3202147,eng,Tom told Mary that his dog had died.
5735792,eng,I would say it's a gray area.
3726073,eng,I intend to go on doing so.
2478592,eng,I will do anything you say!
3431230,eng,Tom has only been gone a day.
10551557,eng,It was cold in the infirmary.
6654445,eng,Tom said that he didn't understand what Mary said in French.
6649146,eng,Tom said that he thought that he was too drunk to do that.
7541054,eng,Tom and Mary locked eyes for a brief moment.
7436147,eng,Tom and Mary said that they'd be tempted to do that.
9250775,eng,Nobody died today.
8617448,eng,That's why we have a constitution in Algeria.
10450963,eng,Don't forget to put on your seatbelts.
7157091,eng,I've always liked Australia.
1333778,eng,Tom told Mary that she was being childish.
69170,eng,Are you correct?
7230425,eng,I don't think that Tom knows why Mary and John are fighting.
18377,eng,"If you're not prepared to take the trouble to learn how to train a dog, don't get one."
9681850,eng,"Eventually, we all die."
3312627,eng,We thought you were coming with us.
9091702,eng,Skura bought a new Kabyle dress.
1290752,eng,He sent me an urgent telegram.
7171301,eng,I thought that you said you were born in Boston.
6678603,eng,I should've read the signs.
10598988,eng,Tom got his dog back.
8445463,eng,Should I buy this dress?
7356780,eng,"Once again, you win."
7633591,eng,I've forgotten to bring something to write with.
8247602,eng,"When he left Algeria, he missed it."
5879186,eng,"There are three things that do not exist in the world: a cover for the sea, a ladder into the sky, a cure for love."
288952,eng,I don't think he'll say yes.
9634674,eng,What will you cook today?
2270491,eng,Don't lower your eyes.
6510644,eng,I'd never seen Tom and Mary do that before.
6743544,eng,I wasn't as hesitant to do that as Tom seemed to be.
6043579,eng,Layla's death didn't serve any purpose.
3098942,eng,I kind of worry about stuff like that.
6527847,eng,"Tom was going to tell Mary, but he forgot."
9198599,eng,Do you like mangoes?
1583314,eng,"You don't need to know everything, you just need to know where to search."
2563108,eng,"The chicken is worth four annas, and the masala is worth twelve annas."
7514565,eng,I know that Tom seldom does that anymore.
5753401,eng,Tom hasn't won a race.
6409185,eng,She looked at him with starry eyes.
8358053,eng,Tom really does look a lot like his father.
328624,eng,"That 'Ayumi' kid, only 13 but has performed in movies and theatres as a child actor since she was five."
2847768,eng,I'm not correcting your exercises.
7173776,eng,I thought I told you to stay where you were.
1955097,eng,I can't use it.
3324560,eng,Tom asked Mary to play tennis with him.
9432989,eng,"Yanni was tearing through the woods, looking for anything burnable."
9381614,eng,The pickup truck turned around again.
6490656,eng,Tom and Mary said their parents allow them to do whatever they want to do.
2397730,eng,"If I go to another country in the EU as a tourist, are there any steps I have to take?"
10235406,eng,Ziri helps Rima.
300242,eng,He asked me some questions about the math test.
7229174,eng,I don't think that Tom knows that Mary should do that.
9018889,eng,He is said to live in New York.
34597,eng,Bill was careless in handling his pistol.
1723942,eng,What will tomorrow be? The beginning or the end?
655054,eng,"If anyone can do it, you can."
7732486,eng,I told Tom I was claustrophobic.
9045327,eng,I made an appointment with the dentist.
6228615,eng,"You didn't know that we were the ones who did that, did you?"
10257461,eng,"Shall I go to the washroom for a moment, I wonder."
6257751,eng,Tom said Mary knew she might be required to do that.
8248902,eng,He's the imam of a mosque in Bejaia.
253375,eng,I am sure of winning the tennis match.
10372103,eng,I feel really good here.
3823723,eng,Tom had to stay in the hospital.
5715972,eng,Preoccupation with sex is the basis of all mental activity.
6943038,eng,The flight will be landing soon.
8783181,eng,He's heading up for the village.
2470403,eng,"I felt afraid of being left alone, and for three whole days I wandered about the town in profound dejection, not knowing what to do with myself."
10665380,eng,I agree with her.
6664095,eng,Tom told us what changes he thought should be made.
3001287,eng,The worst is behind you.
4837171,eng,Don't make fun of me. I'm serious.
10564548,eng,You learn more from a lost game than from a hundred won.
3024391,eng,How did you find out it was Tom who stole your bicycle?
7790170,eng,I don't know if I can go to the party.
6527042,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has gone shopping recently.
8838735,eng,He's spent the holidays doing DIY.
10597158,eng,Please don't wait for us.
9922091,eng,It's already summer.
280633,eng,Nobody is so busy that they cannot find time to read.
1450189,eng,"It was very cold, but I went out."
1529440,eng,It's all a matter of semantics.
6828288,eng,Sex is still a taboo.
3152523,eng,Tom never gave me a hard time.
4967670,eng,We're both rich.
6341744,eng,It would be great if we could sing together.
7171288,eng,I thought that you said that you wanted Tom to know that you really didn't want to do that.
326235,eng,The train was full of passengers.
3498798,eng,"Tom was right, wasn't he?"
10442727,eng,This is the best restaurant I've been to.
287468,eng,His clothes were dripping.
1951387,eng,Tom can't catch a break.
7672673,eng,You forgot my boyfriend is gay.
9241101,eng,No one came here.
7515910,eng,I know that I'm not likely to be fired.
2144566,eng,I prefer salad for supper; I'm usually not hungry at this time of the day.
289220,eng,He's always worrying about his daughter.
324372,eng,I have been to the station to see a friend off.
3918914,eng,Call her now.
907398,eng,"Socrates said, ""Those who want fewest things are nearest to the gods."""
6647310,eng,Tom told everyone that he was suspicious.
3408977,eng,Tom was just teasing.
3739689,eng,"Great thanks, friends."
291051,eng,He was the strongest candidate for the position.
1029931,eng,Tom and Mary are brother and sister.
283764,eng,I was informed of his failure in the examination.
6715488,eng,Sami lived in a shipping container.
2545340,eng,I'm not here on business.
6517414,eng,"Tom and Mary are competitive, aren't they?"
2833547,eng,It matters little if the cat is white or black; the important thing is that it chase rats.
6250701,eng,"Who's that man? ""That's Tom."""
10503823,eng,You always have the option of quitting if you don't like working here.
6523921,eng,I wonder whether Tom was fired or not.
3726555,eng,I never asked you to dinner.
8513855,eng,He watched TV with her.
6340805,eng,I've already told you I don't enjoy doing that.
4013650,eng,I think Tom will be able to solve the problem.
2483520,eng,"I invite comments, but ask you not to resort to insults."
8988821,eng,Tom probably isn't still in his office.
9292811,eng,They didn't go to Taza after all.
3449415,eng,Tom is looking forward to meeting you.
10630130,eng,How do dolphins think? About what do they think or dream?
6421667,eng,Mary said she hopes Tom won't do that.
8761586,eng,"Do you have a girlfriend? ""I'm married."""
7508309,eng,Tom told everyone that he didn't have to do that.
7205401,eng,Sami wrote the order down.
7863881,eng,"In Kabylie, Algeria, everyone speaks Berber."
7152447,eng,Tom told Mary he was moving to Australia.
6162091,eng,Now the child has already fallen in the fountain.
6428723,eng,Mary did what she was told.
287473,eng,His dress betrayed the fact that he was a foreigner.
8420368,eng,I wanted everybody to have a great time.
28678,eng,Skip the pleasantries and get down to business.
1656208,eng,Tom was the first to the table.
6647034,eng,Tom told me he saw someone kissing Mary.
9779372,eng,There's no use yelling for help. Nobody will hear you.
6433599,eng,Tom said that Mary has only done that twice.
6266424,eng,I hope that'll happen soon.
3914067,eng,I regret kissing you.
8053240,eng,I didn't think the hotel business was going to be this hard.
1521255,eng,I'm suffering from anal itching.
6356455,eng,Tom is still depressed.
2956935,eng,Tom has several suggestions.
7861336,eng,Algeria has nomadic tribes.
6123957,eng,You should be helping Tom.
1265893,eng,"Don't look for the way, just remove the obstacles."
2761939,eng,Many people think that being an actor is simply memorizing lines.
953931,eng,"If I could only play the tuba half as well as you, I'd be very happy."
7514621,eng,I know that Tom is still in the hospital.
300930,eng,He was watching the scene with breathless interest.
2541179,eng,Tom wouldn't go to the hospital.
436711,eng,I hope to be able to go in June.
8778015,eng,Lena can become quite a clown when she has an appreciative audience.
310185,eng,She made five mistakes in as many lines.
1138900,eng,I'm not after you.
280963,eng,"If you do such a prank again, you will hear from the owner."
2854171,eng,Emily goes to sleep at 10 o'clock at night.
8667389,eng,There is an arm of a skeleton floating in the water.
7241407,eng,Sami knows you.
2203042,eng,You're irreplaceable.
253855,eng,I was lucky enough to escape unhurt.
7736647,eng,What's the best way to get to Tom's apartment from here?
6343865,eng,I have three brothers and three sisters.
6663918,eng,I don't want to join your group.
2488942,eng,Plants grow towards sunlight.
6577556,eng,"Between Christmas and New Years Day, there's a holiday dead zone."
6586463,eng,"During the SAG ceremony in LA, they raised one million dollars for the Facelifts For Tots charity."
2046903,eng,Can you squeeze me into your busy schedule?
8013270,eng,Tom talked about his girlfriend.
9387314,eng,Tom doesn't like it when you do that to him.
238357,eng,The police released him.
9037952,eng,The people I work with are very talented.
8181733,eng,"Wednesday marks the 18th anniversary of the terror attacks against the United States of Sept. 11, 2001."
7376142,eng,Mary threw her son out of the house.
1026481,eng,Tom did his best.
8013074,eng,"Smell this. ""Yuck! It smells like shit!"""
6336308,eng,I wonder whether Tom will come tonight.
1095514,eng,Tom certainly did an excellent job.
9793827,eng,Yanni refused to say what he had written in that letter.
807177,eng,Bill Clinton was found not guilty.
6651191,eng,Tom said that he won't walk home today.
2768217,eng,Many foreigners come to Japan to learn Japanese.
58626,eng,There's a lot of red tape involved in this procedure.
8535723,eng,She couldn't contain herself.
6954751,eng,My wife is from Australia.
7868325,eng,I haven't spoken Berber in years.
9797443,eng,Yanni enjoyed the video.
6494461,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought they might not have to do that here.
1975750,eng,Tom doesn't actually speak much French.
434324,eng,Before going to France we decided to study French.
6244044,eng,I think Tom wouldn't have to do that.
1661167,eng,Tom is playing piano.
5178627,eng,Let's talk a bit about that.
265406,eng,I wish I had a car.
6506132,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they enjoyed doing that.
250069,eng,"As for me, I have nothing against the plan."
8839774,eng,I love Eastern Iranian languages.
5729794,eng,They will have been dealt with.
9354217,eng,We have just over a week left.
6241005,eng,Tom says he doesn't have to do that either.
1556974,eng,How do you make a triangle-shaped onigiri? No matter how many times I try I can only make round onigiri.
8567500,eng,He can help you from Algeria.
8340429,eng,My flashlight is broken.
6243971,eng,I warned Tom not to do that too much.
6338291,eng,"As soon as Tom got out of the bath, he ate dinner."
9518513,eng,My biggest regret was not ever telling Tom that I loved him while he was still alive.
1976363,eng,We can't avoid postponing our departure.
2841254,eng,We were all present at the conference.
1174860,eng,The writers know many songs.
5739674,eng,The adjustment is painful.
8905394,eng,"Australia plays an active role in the WTO, APEC, the G20, and other trade forums."
3729034,eng,I'm learning Turkmen.
7121181,eng,Sami will take care of everything when Layla is gone.
10784871,eng,Her wish is my command.
7794439,eng,"This is not a cat, it is a dog."
7385633,eng,She needed to change her plan.
4515246,eng,What is a planetary year?
7191610,eng,Do you think you'll stay in Australia long?
2044629,eng,Tom was happy to see Mary.
5817697,eng,Wait. I can erase it.
8836753,eng,They're having an afternoon kip.
10186164,eng,Yanni talks to Rima every day.
8380733,eng,Tom has been in a bad mood all day.
32895,eng,I have attached a Microsoft Excel file.
5360972,eng,"An aide told reporters, off the record, that the senator had been lying."
7888225,eng,Tom has a long life line on his hand.
9075014,eng,Algerians don't like snobby people.
2646739,eng,What're you counting?
7198924,eng,"It's not what you say, but just the opposite."
3903066,eng,I'd like a word with her.
7501729,eng,I know Tom knows that Mary probably doesn't need to do that anymore.
3075087,eng,"Even though Tom eats mostly junk food, he rarely gets sick and his BMI is in the normal range."
238192,eng,It was Mike that telephoned the police.
274915,eng,A number of tickets are sold in advance.
1403508,eng,I don't care about presents. It would have made no difference if you hadn't brought this.
8878881,eng,She told me she was going to take the train.
6492657,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
2834784,eng,This play has a feminist point of view.
7175715,eng,Tom thinks that Mary is still living in Boston.
9199423,eng,Tom and Mary put their spacesuits on.
6148324,eng,Ask your doctors.
3415135,eng,Tom cried all morning.
9264961,eng,We can get there by bus.
6115218,eng,Tom mortgaged his house.
5916709,eng,Mary begged Tom not to do that.
7379008,eng,"Mary is quite serious, isn't she?"
8007401,eng,Mennad doesn't give a crap about religion.
10129909,eng,"The castle is situated in a tract of wild, isolated country, and has not been inhabited for a long time."
6580503,eng,Mary placed a plate stacked with pancakes on the table.
8535923,eng,He sat at the bar drinking by himself.
1533852,eng,Tom was covered with sweat.
10055715,eng,"You're not a morning person, I understand."
6346632,eng,Do we really want Tom to do that?
2389218,eng,The suspect must leave all his personal belongings on the table.
242539,eng,Please come here between two and three this afternoon.
6418426,eng,Mary says she doesn't think it's possible.
6702157,eng,Someone broke into Tom's house last night.
2538916,eng,I'm not supposed to leave the building.
1098011,eng,John is a big boy.
3118254,eng,I worked hard for this money.
7399863,eng,He said he'll do that for you.
7444830,eng,They told me they'd leave soon.
5130826,eng,"Are we gonna get some beer, dude?"
3201784,eng,We'll have to tell Tom eventually.
8043134,eng,They'll do that.
3579638,eng,Atletico Madrid surprised everyone with their win against Barcelona as they’ve always been the underdogs in the Spanish league.
10119097,eng,"If you really cared about Tom, you would have helped him."
6430554,eng,Tom didn't tell Mary that he was married.
3417026,eng,"Tom is quite outspoken, isn't he?"
294094,eng,He is going back and forth in front of the station.
10121875,eng,It's possible Tom came here when he was a boy.
6123221,eng,Do you think I should let Tom do that?
7377771,eng,Mary brushed the snow off her coat.
6409001,eng,Mary is still thinking about whether she should go or not.
8049596,eng,Mennad never goes to parties.
4001379,eng,"Before you reached drinking age, you couldn't stand family parties."
2026894,eng,I just want to make sure it's not poison.
6818482,eng,Nobody suspected me.
6257918,eng,"You're a gun owner, aren't you?"
7516074,eng,I knew that Tom wasn't a very nice boy.
6686335,eng,They got married two years ago.
3914875,eng,We could've helped him.
315889,eng,"She goes to the dentist regularly, so she seldom gets toothache."
2958012,eng,Tom said you might be interested in this book.
4890999,eng,I can tell you a thing or two about it.
300886,eng,He was lying on the grass.
7355853,eng,"The squirrel, the ape and the monkey, are kept at home for amusement. The dormouse and other larger mice, such as the weevil, the martin, the ferret, trouble the home."
10773872,eng,Ziri is Rima's karate teacher.
3523575,eng,This could save many lives.
6728616,eng,I didn't say I would do that.
4102979,eng,"First, let's talk about Tom."
10704146,eng,He stuck his hand into the hornets' nest.
10672467,eng,The male hornbill lost his life.
7733980,eng,I just opened the door a little to let in some air.
10121729,eng,We saw a Chinese film in this cinema on Saturday night.
2128874,eng,Substituting textbooks and handouts with hand-held computers could actually save money in the long run.
2648924,eng,Tom may be back.
2942451,eng,Congratulations! You're a clown.
9353344,eng,I stretched my arms.
1665644,eng,I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
8522378,eng,She doesn't seem to recognize him.
7516067,eng,I knew that you expected me to do that.
1887916,eng,I was being ironic.
5826392,eng,Tom's birthday is in October and mine is in November.
8273437,eng,They are all looking for them.
5395080,eng,Mary sat on her bed crying.
3620487,eng,How long did Tom go out with Mary?
250702,eng,My brother is big enough to travel alone.
8122873,eng,Algeria procuces oil and gas.
4783274,eng,Santa Claus was an Anatolian saint.
6349556,eng,Tom seemed to be very satisfied.
3991223,eng,Dan bought an acre of land in Nevada.
3441979,eng,It's a huge contract.
9926485,eng,They were not ill.
6437940,eng,Tom fell down and hurt his knee.
1770489,eng,"Next time I see this sentence, I will translate it."
326739,eng,Short tempered as ever. He said while dodging Reika's fist.
8180443,eng,Do you think that Tom could do that?
7033469,eng,She has a good relationship with her mother-in-law.
9460583,eng,We'll ride at sunrise.
9130130,eng,It'd be better if you did it right away.
5788096,eng,I'm kind to everyone and grateful.
9670933,eng,I plan to do that before next Monday.
7987602,eng,Sami stayed in the hallway.
9666913,eng,Cows are sacred animals in India.
8683362,eng,Louise only wears asymmetrical dresses.
4493661,eng,We have no electricity.
6230532,eng,I thought you weren't supposed to do that by yourself.
2545577,eng,I want to get a real job.
10148823,eng,Why don't we play another game of chess?
2648533,eng,"Hey, this is nice."
7131581,eng,Tom remained silent during dinner.
2719891,eng,She sowed wheat in her field.
7475949,eng,They can go whenever they like.
1184643,eng,Vultures circled over the dead bodies.
2544771,eng,I'm going to need details.
2202699,eng,Tom is correct.
5149974,eng,Tom denied that.
10794503,eng,I gained a lot of weight over the summer.
850889,eng,Is that your book?
10622108,eng,There's none so deaf as those who won't hear.
6867987,eng,I should have left early.
7317866,eng,Sami wondered why Layla's face was red.
7388164,eng,He has a pen in his hand.
6258107,eng,Would you please come tomorrow?
328594,eng,Thank you for your business. Please come again!
6293947,eng,Earth has plenty of mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains in the U.S. are just two of them.
2796838,eng,Tom was overcome with jealousy.
10631648,eng,French isn't the only language that Tom knows.
3050562,eng,You have your whole life ahead of you.
7194963,eng,Are you really serious about going to Australia?
4944856,eng,The merchant seems to be an honest person.
7070477,eng,Sami wanted a dog.
5701995,eng,"The Soviet Union was dissolved on December 26, 1991."
6688008,eng,Tell Tom how to spell your name.
4403681,eng,Don't cry over spilled milk.
6560917,eng,My hearing is going.
6267946,eng,Tom is likely to be grateful.
7149433,eng,Tom was the only one who didn't know that Mary had moved to Australia.
6957691,eng,"It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face."
3729182,eng,That'd be a good color for you.
8034903,eng,Mennad isn't in here.
6861855,eng,I probably would've done the same thing.
9796057,eng,Yanni wanted a nice place for his little girl to grow up.
2007630,eng,Let's go watch a movie.
7737310,eng,Why does Tom like Boston so much?
6335328,eng,Tom isn't planning on doing that again.
10731824,eng,I do want to lend you money.
8198011,eng,"No, it is not."
8988150,eng,Mom and Dad probably won't get mad.
9988802,eng,He emptied a tankard of beer.
478579,eng,This candy cane tastes like green apple.
10650004,eng,The lake was icebound.
1050549,eng,Today I just feel like staying at home and doing nothing.
20078,eng,Hunger knows no law.
7127481,eng,How can they stop us from going to school?
2890432,eng,I pretended to be asleep.
2254311,eng,I get up at seven every morning.
7168495,eng,I think that Tom is charming.
3723724,eng,I can figure it out myself.
7401393,eng,"He hasn't called you, has he?"
6506344,eng,I think Tom and Mary are going to do that today.
6417498,eng,Mary used to be able to do that by herself.
2271981,eng,I won't permit it.
1745434,eng,Catholic leaders urge all of us to unite in the church.
10159790,eng,Tom didn't know what happened.
4666160,eng,Tom didn't seem convinced.
7202263,eng,Sami completely cut all ties with Layla once he got fired.
8509903,eng,Tom didn't find out he was adopted until he was thirty years old.
7070667,eng,I left my dog.
5839181,eng,Fadil did very well financially.
7127014,eng,How much room is there to expand?
8916108,eng,"I speak a little French, but I'm not fluent."
1901,eng,It's presumptuous for humans to assume that our task is to do what only God can do.
6428562,eng,Mary said she felt seasick.
6407520,eng,Mary said she thought she was the only one who needed to do that.
270994,eng,"In mathematics and English, he is second to none in the class."
8045401,eng,Sledding is a lot of fun.
6494565,eng,Tom and Mary couldn't possibly have opened that door by themselves.
71054,eng,May I ask you a question?
1046755,eng,Give up that idea.
2775335,eng,Who deals the cards now?
6530711,eng,Tom says he's very happy here.
5360452,eng,Tom unpacked his sleeping bag.
6356500,eng,Tom has agreed to wait.
7509528,eng,I didn't know that you weren't going to do that.
1922106,eng,Tom tried to pry open the box with a crowbar.
9011848,eng,Who doesn't feel well?
7398624,eng,She said that she was supportive.
10659734,eng,It's a little windy today.
6249136,eng,I hope that Tom doesn't do that.
4663232,eng,I'm not convinced you know what you're doing.
760537,eng,We asked him what he was called.
9440272,eng,The vehicle is very nippy and well suited to city traffic.
6870048,eng,I think Tom could have refused to do that.
7146361,eng,Sami got himself dressed.
9530247,eng,You used to have to buy a platform ticket if you wanted to go with someone as far as the train.
2415711,eng,"Since the temperature has warmed, my coat has become an encumbrance."
3951927,eng,The euro and the dollar are now worth about the same.
5099179,eng,Language is the fountain of communication.
6340638,eng,Tom is very unlikely to stop crying anytime soon.
6022993,eng,Few people know of its existence.
7791565,eng,I can't even believe Tom isn't here.
8249582,eng,He kept studying Islam.
24608,eng,Nothing is as precious as friendship.
9779152,eng,"If there's one message to cut through to everyone in this country, it's this: The vaccines are safe."
10518680,eng,Tom isn't even trying to lose weight.
10021902,eng,"In these times of crisis, many people have to buckle down."
6341200,eng,I hope that Tom can take care of himself.
3822082,eng,I don't like my neighbors.
8319148,eng,"Last month, he went to Italy."
2647337,eng,What did they offer?
10776649,eng,Tom divided us into two groups.
8473013,eng,One of the babies started crying and all of the others joined in.
3023611,eng,Tom is reading a magazine.
8521408,eng,She couldn't control him.
7439671,eng,They said they'd never leave early.
6526961,eng,Tom wanted to know if he can come over and play.
7374287,eng,Mary will be furious when she finds out.
6665863,eng,I had a duplicate key made.
9267198,eng,What is the reason?
6634958,eng,"They pretend to be sanctimonious but, in fact, they are hypocrite and despicable."
1094853,eng,Tom did his best to protect Mary.
7416486,eng,"In three days—that is to say, on Monday next—matters will be ripe, and the Professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police."
8604924,eng,Pour the drain opener in the drain.
43652,eng,The question is not so easy that everyone can answer it.
9643524,eng,That's how we all feel.
7329389,eng,Sami went back to the school.
271326,eng,Success depends on your efforts.
6407230,eng,Mary says she doesn't believe Tom really plans to do that this week.
9188949,eng,"After that, he didn't come back."
7510852,eng,I know Tom won't wait until Monday to do that.
6237598,eng,"You didn't know Tom would do that, did you?"
1966495,eng,"This storm, too, shall pass."
7209065,eng,Sami needs to come back with an ID.
9689908,eng,Yanni isn't as generous as he appears.
7443310,eng,Tom and Mary took off their cowboy hats.
4538697,eng,Nobody can stop me from talking to Marika.
323447,eng,"Rain, rain go away!"
6120652,eng,Tom was the first one to realize that Mary was having a hard time doing that.
4398824,eng,We've finally reached the summit.
6420480,eng,Mary blames Tom for all of her problems.
5488092,eng,The rabbit jumped over the dog.
3714653,eng,Tom staked his tomatoes with Mary's old stockings.
532901,eng,Can you imagine?
8295573,eng,He cried thinking about his ordeal and its unending aftermath.
9415120,eng,Yanni always wears long pants.
7409350,eng,They wanted me to teach them French.
8349073,eng,Do you really believe that's what Tom wants?
10197499,eng,Are all the doors closed?
2241018,eng,We already tried.
250812,eng,Would you like to add anything to what I've said?
7502326,eng,I knew Tom thought it would be a good idea to help Mary do that.
6083658,eng,What have you been doing since I last met you?
3738507,eng,Who do you think can fix this?
8826830,eng,Which month are you?
7170955,eng,I know that Tom would've liked that.
6979487,eng,Tom jumped the queue in front of me.
7587165,eng,"If I can be of assistance to you in some way, just let me know."
295511,eng,"He's not rich, but he's happy."
6772064,eng,Tom wouldn't accept my gift.
8341469,eng,Tom watched Mary walk into the hospital.
3738690,eng,Could we talk about last night?
6927492,eng,Tom and I know each other pretty well.
6526517,eng,Tom and Mary said they want to write a book together.
890384,eng,"That day, it rained on and off all day."
8608170,eng,Tom bought the cheapest thing in the store.
62793,eng,Tom broke his right leg and was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas.
7266535,eng,Sami can come back tomorrow.
3209784,eng,They cannot drive a car.
6909014,eng,Tom hears the chirps of sparrows.
6428564,eng,Mary said she feels better.
6576635,eng,Slide over here next to me.
6437652,eng,Tom will be really proud of you.
7378693,eng,Mary told everyone she was broke.
8960628,eng,My grandfather loves listening to his old records on his record player.
7288238,eng,Sami doesn't have issues with Layla.
8923520,eng,Did you say ninety or nineteen?
2952624,eng,I was up all night doing homework.
272136,eng,There used to be a large cedar tree there.
2182547,eng,Don't understand.
5688157,eng,I never really wanted to do that.
10730799,eng,French toast is best with spinach pottage.
8395722,eng,Did you go straight to the gym?
6620346,eng,"Her father refused to have anything to do with her, because she had married without his consent, and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well."
7438679,eng,They said that they'd be going by train.
6436604,eng,Tom isn't likely to let Mary drive.
3129764,eng,How could that have happened?
7861031,eng,Islamic banking is becoming more and more important in Algeria.
2014727,eng,"I'd like your attention, please."
6691303,eng,Sami helped Layla up.
10607656,eng,Ziri built his tortoise an enclosure.
508262,eng,My older brother knows how to drive.
6437208,eng,What's Boston like in the summer?
5892419,eng,This book is worth every penny.
6026601,eng,Mary gave me a manicure.
398541,eng,Hanging out with him isn't interesting.
7190655,eng,I assume that you're here to volunteer.
8825240,eng,Does Tom like folk music?
3730063,eng,We're investigating the deaths of Tom and Mary.
6713382,eng,What was your beef?
7910873,eng,Your eyes are red. What happened?
2951431,eng,We finally reached the lake.
7477239,eng,This spider is a deadly animal.
7164564,eng,I heard you might be moving to Australia.
24406,eng,"Mr Kato, who lives in Paris, misses his family left at home."
10737868,eng,I admire your candor.
5850855,eng,That isn't likely to happen.
8015482,eng,Tom confessed to the cops.
7932727,eng,Everybody went home satisfied.
2585461,eng,I am going to repeat it so that you won't forget it.
7036848,eng,"Strange news we hear: A Trojan Greeks obey, / Helenus, master of the spouse and sway / of Pyrrhus, and Andromache once more / has yielded to a Trojan lord."
32065,eng,There goes a wonderful coach over there.
5816266,eng,Tom knows how to sell houses.
253834,eng,I can't drink coffee as sweet as this.
3184392,eng,Do you think Tom wants to go to Boston with us?
7170887,eng,I know that Tom will do that.
3419977,eng,Tom is ashamed of his body.
25549,eng,"If I were prime minister, I'd give Clinton a good talking to."
6600563,eng,"If that is so, we have to try to comprehend what it is."
328510,eng,"This e-zine is for those who, unswayed by the cajolery of the modern language industry, firmly trust that the traditional learning method of grammatical analysis is the way to go."
7112474,eng,Tom is likely to be fast.
7470580,eng,Tom and Mary swore that they wouldn't leave early.
2601538,eng,"Red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning."
5742779,eng,Call it anything you want.
9729080,eng,Which one of these is yours?
57637,eng,This animal is very clever.
6671945,eng,Mary curled into a ball.
7470564,eng,Tom and Mary forgot where they'd put their glasses.
8681120,eng,She is worried about his health.
41237,eng,How's your diet kick?
7218928,eng,Tom told Mary that he'd finished the work three days before.
7389701,eng,He leaned back in his swivel chair.
9758762,eng,Yanni will take a look at it.
6984971,eng,Tom and Mary ate s'mores.
6348915,eng,I got back from Boston yesterday.
321978,eng,I got the pears for nothing.
5171549,eng,Can you tell me who's going to come tonight?
268027,eng,The boy came running into the room.
6498284,eng,Tom and Mary forgot to tell John what time they'd be there.
1950877,eng,I can't believe Tom named his kid after you.
9756377,eng,She had never mentioned him.
2287918,eng,Some house.
3515191,eng,Did Tom say anything to you at all?
6993540,eng,"Older LPs, such as Amy Winehouse’s “Back To Black” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours,” were also in the top 10."
2640565,eng,"If you have something to say to me, say it."
6417352,eng,I should've just given Mary what she wanted.
6255502,eng,Tom says he's not enjoying himself.
7163460,eng,I think that I'll stay in Australia for another week.
9870620,eng,Do earthquakes happen often in Australia?
8106748,eng,Tom told Mary about what had happened on Monday.
7209574,eng,Sami copyrighted the pictures.
3915193,eng,How are you going to help us?
7248694,eng,Sami read the text message.
5442677,eng,"Just a minute, please. Don't hang up."
6907723,eng,Are you thirsty now?
9503397,eng,Nobody forces you to eat it.
2961559,eng,Tom came to the United States when he was just seven years old.
5746551,eng,It was kind of a bummer.
3930378,eng,Dan rejected Linda's idea to expose everything to the press.
8401638,eng,I've been down that road.
3563964,eng,Are you both drunk?
6256479,eng,Tom says he didn't know Mary wanted to move to Boston.
9337204,eng,I'm broke. You're loaded.
66950,eng,It's hard to complain against such good people.
5116586,eng,My grandma has a twin.
3396861,eng,They said I wasn't qualified for the job.
2016612,eng,I don't want to have to shoot you.
5989629,eng,I have the impression that we've known each other for a long time.
7390826,eng,He refuses to eat his vegetables.
7241688,eng,Layla's hair is straight.
6242264,eng,I don't need to know how Tom does that.
3728238,eng,You gave me a fright.
6909127,eng,She was hailed for her virtuous and selfless demeanor.
3444877,eng,But he's still alive?
8991383,eng,Let's change now.
5640175,eng,I don't remember too much.
7160656,eng,Sami called the building security.
10287616,eng,I don't think that I'd agree to that.
8182173,eng,I can't believe Tom did that for me.
2546561,eng,I'm not going anyplace.
6531381,eng,Tom used to be a bartender.
2647656,eng,"It's hard, you know."
1557062,eng,They ganged up on him.
35062,eng,Harry couldn't keep up with the class.
7535814,eng,Tom and Mary refused my help and did it on their own.
8069770,eng,Tom is an awful driver.
435251,eng,What kind of job are you looking for?
7745222,eng,Tom's flat is small.
69706,eng,Do you know if Lucy can speak Japanese?
8770102,eng,This test is too easy.
304343,eng,He graduated from Harvard University with honors.
29602,eng,Money burns a hole in Linda's pocket.
6525347,eng,Tom and Mary both giggled.
7857389,eng,Berber speakers are a minority inside Algeria.
6219061,eng,"Since the scandal, our sales have been plummeting."
10530973,eng,My hair is dry now.
5852633,eng,Do you plan on attending today's meeting?
6530967,eng,Tom said that he wasn't full.
270221,eng,Man's body is a sort of machine.
6512177,eng,Tell Tom and Mary not to do that by themselves.
7334210,eng,Sami and his mom didn't speak to each other for six weeks.
3286982,eng,"So far, they've found nothing."
8366107,eng,Let's not stray from the subject.
306748,eng,They ended capitalism and built a socialist society.
6358532,eng,Should I sing?
6712922,eng,Sami couldn't afford that.
2033376,eng,I didn't want to insult Tom.
7156969,eng,I've been to Australia more than once.
8929193,eng,Aren't they going to make money in Lithuania?
3202410,eng,Tell me where you want to go tonight.
4416074,eng,You're more beautiful than I imagined.
10531082,eng,Tom won't call me back.
6351503,eng,Why is Tom nervous?
5737078,eng,Tom is unfit to be a teacher.
8995563,eng,Did Tom do it the way Mary said he did it?
8988922,eng,A wasp flew in the window.
8184089,eng,I told Tom that Mary didn't have to do that.
10684587,eng,Marx and Engels were prophets.
328993,eng,"I'm living on welfare, without a car or anything."
5659237,eng,Tom doesn't know what Mary wants him to say.
7303330,eng,Sing with me.
10544696,eng,The fever is giving me chills.
5860166,eng,"People should be beautiful in every way—in their faces, in the way they dress, in their thoughts and in their innermost selves."
10616117,eng,Shopping carts have a will of their own. They always want to turn right.
3768916,eng,"For next class, I want you guys to transcribe the lyrics from any singer as long as it's in English."
885202,eng,Your timing really sucks.
9358938,eng,That is even worse.
6826675,eng,You should be sensitive to your partner's emotional needs.
10023461,eng,Yanni spent the weekend in a motel.
9778679,eng,I'm going to give you a final chance.
5176557,eng,The white umbrella is yours.
42969,eng,So the captain took care of him.
2643579,eng,Tom knew nothing about Mary.
2629879,eng,"Are you happy to be alive? ""Yes, I'm happy."""
64322,eng,It seems you and I are essential to this project. We'd better get along or it'll go badly.
7500835,eng,Tom said he wondered whether Mary and I would really be able to do that by ourselves.
9826438,eng,Tom was the one who made lunch.
4777053,eng,I ate a panipuri.
6416522,eng,Mary didn't know what she'd be allowed to do.
6508244,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they were embarrassed.
248073,eng,We were looking at the picture.
3093360,eng,The grief-stricken family had to wait more than a decade to see their son's killer brought to justice.
6849172,eng,Doing that was really easy.
3312447,eng,We have very little in common.
6655220,eng,Tom said that he could probably help us do that.
3390705,eng,Are you going back to Boston?
1789192,eng,She cannot be saved.
8160891,eng,Don't reach out your hand to a lion.
9149740,eng,Our website needs to be brought to life with eye-catching photos and videos.
6778868,eng,I really like Tatoeba.
9822184,eng,Tom has just bought a new house.
63210,eng,I've loved you from the moment I saw you.
7240219,eng,I think you should know I don't really like you very much.
6699153,eng,I bought this jacket for $30.
2540749,eng,We should've gotten here earlier.
2359774,eng,I've got to talk to someone.
6524945,eng,Tom and Mary both want to go home.
9824549,eng,Yanni and Skura were both furious.
10475882,eng,You fell off of the boat.
7517810,eng,I know Tom will be doing that alone.
3918546,eng,Why did they dislike her?
2214468,eng,I decided to study all night long.
312770,eng,She wears a lot of makeup.
8396076,eng,How different do you think the world will be in a hundred years?
6049164,eng,Will we ever see Tom again?
1416028,eng,When do you go on vacation?
3904213,eng,I totally agree with her.
7110848,eng,I think that Tom is distraught.
9958760,eng,Yanni saved Skura's life.
266707,eng,It is very nice of you to help me with my homework.
9408116,eng,"I'm sorry, I haven't talked to you in a whole month."
6017417,eng,Layla got divorced.
10026734,eng,Yanni bought Skura a cappuccino machine.
56650,eng,It's almost impossible to work out this problem.
2642127,eng,Tom forgot to pay his phone bill.
10210232,eng,Ziri became a cocktail waiter.
6422523,eng,Mary refused to tell us what she did.
5078167,eng,Our success is guaranteed.
8080512,eng,He is rude and ignorant and people avoid him.
4416424,eng,"Freedom is something you have to fight for, rather than something you're given."
1267133,eng,A fallen tree blocked the road.
9796020,eng,Yanni wants to settle down.
10026663,eng,Yanni needs his cash.
2040317,eng,He sat down beside her.
6246091,eng,It'll be almost impossible to do that.
7382303,eng,Mary is in her car.
10193580,eng,The thrust of this spacecraft is minuscule.
6359716,eng,"He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman."
3752923,eng,You can't come in with this.
7730039,eng,I have visited Boston before.
10622708,eng,I think it would be best for you to stay quiet.
8935617,eng,He is a cashier at a supermarket.
8971966,eng,You're probably the only one who can carry this bag.
4910081,eng,I want you to utilize that object.
3171067,eng,We can end it.
8091523,eng,"Tom is Scottish, but he doesn't speak Scots."
2784050,eng,I woke up with a stiff neck.
3659813,eng,"I leave the house at eight fifteen, and arrive at school at eight forty‐five."
1024057,eng,Tom used to be drunk by this time every night.
2349841,eng,The repeated triplets are the most prominent motif in that movement of the symphony.
10113499,eng,Some blame politicians.
241575,eng,What will happen if there's power failure now?
6492935,eng,Tom and Mary were mad at me because I wouldn't do what they asked me to do.
3182111,eng,Tom obviously wanted to talk to me privately.
2539075,eng,Tom usually eats only two meals a day.
10225716,eng,Ziri tried to make this Christmas special.
6233438,eng,Is Tom really asleep?
5738328,eng,I don't want the money now.
2547565,eng,Tom lost his balance.
7168242,eng,I think that Tom doesn't like me very much.
9250035,eng,What makes you feel alive?
5085488,eng,I worked for him for ten years.
9117004,eng,Yanni was trying to walk with the help of his walker.
627332,eng,I'm not as talkative as you.
10648994,eng,How could things have gotten this bad?
8782821,eng,She wrenched her back when she flew off the ramp while riding a runaway snowmobile.
7177365,eng,Tom said that Mary was unconvinced.
62224,eng,A cup of coffee refreshed me.
7267751,eng,Sami found no one in the house.
304318,eng,"He broke his word, which made his wife angry."
7403077,eng,"He looks young, doesn't he?"
260903,eng,I conducted him out.
1318004,eng,Don't expose him to the rain!
7578527,eng,We're not afraid of terrorists.
6274278,eng,Tom said Mary wasn't bored.
6352737,eng,You ought to get some sleep.
8532288,eng,She couldn't stand to be in the same room with him.
2713750,eng,We both love Tom.
1094967,eng,Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to take vitamins.
1898050,eng,We hardly ever see each other anymore. We might as well be strangers.
4495380,eng,We never bribed anyone.
804305,eng,The people voted in November.
9998991,eng,Tom is a big dude.
7156261,eng,Sami doesn't feel very good.
301808,eng,He took the wrong train by mistake.
6502033,eng,Tom and Mary were hoping they wouldn't have to do that.
7174324,eng,I thought that I would find you there.
2511848,eng,I was just about to leave when the telephone rang.
10024047,eng,Yanni doesn't consider this romantic.
7376596,eng,"Mary is next on the list, isn't she?"
7071662,eng,Tom has two more toys than Mary.
8078651,eng,Tom isn't afraid to get his hands dirty.
2455364,eng,"If even I don't know this, how would you know?"
9281567,eng,Yanni has a mansion-style house.
1096298,eng,You need to relax.
9548993,eng,Let's talk about it now!
2784324,eng,That's an original idea.
1826165,eng,Why does luck hate them?
2955920,eng,Tom asked for directions to the nearest hospital.
7403140,eng,She looked like she was glad.
49951,eng,"May I see that blouse, please?"
264900,eng,A dictionary defines words.
1358270,eng,The executioner fondled his hatchet and smiled complacently. He felt he was a cut above the rest.
10608561,eng,When did you decide to get into porn?
10726308,eng,This isn't a sheep. It's a goat.
8591345,eng,Tom can't stand doing things like that.
6890947,eng,I enjoy riding my bicycle.
7170558,eng,I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to get the box open.
2644307,eng,Tom told some dirty jokes.
8614118,eng,He got in the fight.
8388951,eng,Public transportation is cheap in Algeria.
2451425,eng,Tom can speak French and English.
2252608,eng,There are discrepancies.
6647117,eng,Tom told me he could get us what we need.
10109902,eng,Algeria produces energy.
3653208,eng,You've won my heart.
315426,eng,She is giving the baby a bath.
3911200,eng,I owe them thirty dollars.
8297332,eng,He speaks Berber fantastically.
6531863,eng,We enjoyed our vacation.
5858345,eng,I went sightseeing.
6429158,eng,Mary said she was hungry.
2720423,eng,Guinevere was King Arthur's wife.
8409717,eng,Please don't peek.
6500390,eng,I thought Tom and Mary would be doing that by themselves.
10112051,eng,"In Algeria, agriculture remains a big employer."
3636507,eng,What's the plan now?
7472541,eng,Tom and Mary say that they were fired.
2290875,eng,What kind of chocolate do you like?
5747368,eng,Just make something up.
7384649,eng,She brushed her teeth.
9828669,eng,"Matoub Lounes is buried in his native village, in Kabylie, Algeria."
4752654,eng,The mind needs exercise as well as the body.
7176617,eng,Tom knows that we aren't busy.
2387834,eng,I need your expertise.
6693236,eng,Sami ran an escort service.
7438150,eng,They said that they knew that they could win.
6521161,eng,Do Tom and Mary have to be here?
6263397,eng,I hope Tom is faster at doing that than Mary.
6409531,eng,Mary wouldn't be doing that today if she didn't have to.
7399276,eng,She yelled as loud as she could.
1681901,eng,I cannot boil water. There is no gas.
6796731,eng,I'd prefer not to go swimming today.
9831269,eng,I've heard you're reliable.
425133,eng,What time do you go to work?
10052860,eng,Yanni loves his foster parents so much.
5839233,eng,Fadil demanded that Dania give him the money.
8326169,eng,My mother packed my suitcase for me.
329299,eng,Did you catch the train?!
6427193,eng,Mary looks like she's curious.
8844961,eng,It's time to go out.
9959165,eng,The door has a cross on it.
7194716,eng,I didn't think that Tom would be glad that that happened.
3146990,eng,Scratch a cynic and you'll find a disappointed idealist.
6935634,eng,Tom is severely allergic to grass.
8479834,eng,He won't listen.
6912133,eng,How much did it cost you to get to Boston?
8028328,eng,"Antoine Lavoisier was born in Paris, France."
6412258,eng,Mary had to do that even though she didn't want to.
271560,eng,I don't suppose it's going to be sunny.
436787,eng,I love living with you.
7176346,eng,Tom knows Mary was in prison for three years.
7287314,eng,Sami is a complete fucking asshole.
10688089,eng,This French singer is really wonderful.
3763372,eng,Did he notice something suspicious?
8925226,eng,We have a lot of stuff to do.
6944113,eng,"Tom is still in shock, isn't he?"
5806456,eng,"Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, Caligula even gave this horse a house, a troop of slaves and furniture, for the more elegant entertainment of the guests invited in his name; and it is also said that he planned to make him consul."
5085943,eng,It's a very serious problem.
690269,eng,She remarried when she was in her mid-forties.
7734663,eng,I'm not used to people not agreeing with me.
6445800,eng,Sami is no longer a gang member.
9193431,eng,Tom will write a letter.
6526537,eng,I really don't have time to deal with this right now.
6424080,eng,Mary looks pretty proud of herself.
5222639,eng,She invited me.
2119633,eng,Do you know how to deactivate a bomb?
6082576,eng,I am sitting here.
1113705,eng,I've always loved you.
10140834,eng,Yanni is popular at school.
8748619,eng,I am dizzy.
8243590,eng,"Since she won't go, I won't either."
60740,eng,This tie and that jacket go well together.
3416777,eng,"Tom is unpleasant, isn't he?"
3301012,eng,Are you sure that Tom is going to be there?
7973421,eng,I made a reservation online but I didn't receive a confirmation email.
264848,eng,Freedom is the very essence of our democracy.
277540,eng,"In addition to English, Mr. Nakajima can speak German fluently."
6241622,eng,Did you know Tom didn't need to do that?
9133476,eng,Yanni parked and got out of his car.
5109594,eng,Tom knew all about it.
7440822,eng,They said they didn't do it.
9345369,eng,Someone knocked me down.
4500513,eng,Tom visited Mary in Boston last spring.
4865059,eng,Rabbits have a lot of offspring.
3735780,eng,Wise people learn from their enemies.
3559657,eng,"Tom is poor, but he's happy."
300312,eng,I think that he will succeed.
6108112,eng,Don't call people who are incorrect idiots.
432829,eng,Could you call me back later?
7409965,eng,They looked like they were going to cry.
2030096,eng,How did it go last night?
8573330,eng,This area is recognized by the international community as Palestinian.
7246763,eng,Sami will never go there again.
2908423,eng,I'm your girlfriend.
7226658,eng,I don't think Tom knows I'm a vegetarian.
6110322,eng,Tom still hasn't done that.
6807018,eng,Sami straightened his hair.
10728987,eng,These words are antonyms.
2360197,eng,I have other priorities.
3342857,eng,You should play golf.
45519,eng,He was very much frightened at the sight of the big snake.
6084320,eng,Sami started hitting Layla on the head.
7243147,eng,Sami's bouquet cost six hundred dollars.
2261932,eng,I can't call Tom.
802229,eng,He said they were postponing it.
239124,eng,A dog bit her on the leg.
301510,eng,"He being late, we started without him."
8222200,eng,My own welfare is my top priority.
5843713,eng,I gave up exercising years ago.
10078170,eng,"If Algeria does nothing, the Sahara desert will continue to expand northwards."
6615652,eng,The cat's in heat.
8773090,eng,Salas and Skura bought a lot of food.
8092004,eng,Abundance of love can help to save this world.
5788825,eng,Where is my soft drink?
593267,eng,That's a tower.
294110,eng,He forgot part of his speech and had to ad-lib for a while.
2544721,eng,I'm not going to move out.
7235862,eng,I don't think that Tom could do that by himself.
5570702,eng,Tom's parents ordered their son's tomb to be opened.
8892551,eng,I believe what Tom said.
4665096,eng,How much did this bicycle cost?
5066372,eng,All of these have expired.
6126139,eng,Tom said he couldn't do that again.
282167,eng,"Old and crippled, he had courage enough to do the work."
7748988,eng,I read those messages in Berber.
57583,eng,This road is so broad that buses can pass easily.
6018433,eng,I passed the exam with flying colors.
7408377,eng,They can't do everything by themselves.
5357893,eng,"Following the riots, incidents of looting in affluent neighborhoods multiplied."
8808714,eng,Tom created Minecraft.
4664064,eng,Are you sure Tom will let us do that?
1874243,eng,Tom doesn't seem to recognize Mary.
5251734,eng,Tom plays tennis well.
6342614,eng,Tom seems to have forgotten how to do that.
8921647,eng,Every single second counts.
6898749,eng,Do you still play the flute?
9774949,eng,Sociopaths prioritize their own personal gain.
7520953,eng,You know I'd never hurt you.
3358872,eng,"You not only look like Tom, you sound like him."
5289497,eng,We are sleepy.
2046771,eng,Are you busy Friday night?
6508294,eng,Tom and Mary say they've forgotten how to do that.
9673010,eng,August the eighth is Beard Day in Japan.
7143881,eng,I didn't think that Tom would give it back.
3129600,eng,Tom knew what was going to happen.
8818032,eng,Yanni went to high school with Skura.
7199063,eng,Sami's dog isn't there.
2661173,eng,Does Tom look like he's busy?
10741389,eng,"Don't ask me, mate. I haven't got a clue."
401820,eng,What do you call your father at home?
6410885,eng,Mary shouldn't have ever tried doing that on her own.
40484,eng,I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
3170885,eng,You'll get a copy.
504805,eng,The gods have decreed that man is mortal.
7402153,eng,He said he forgot something.
8414937,eng,His feet were sticking out of the window of his car.
4904171,eng,"Well, this is the street!"
10218071,eng,I don't know if he's aware of that.
9480063,eng,They have fed the dog.
6655790,eng,Tom was sitting in that chair over there this morning.
5161359,eng,His bravery should be praised.
7169483,eng,I think that Tom might get killed if he tries to do that.
2376455,eng,I know where to look.
3509977,eng,Have you seen Tom this morning?
7214526,eng,Sami is gonna keep his mouth shut.
2640928,eng,You have no idea what this means to me.
29252,eng,He went to see her while she stayed in London.
3001105,eng,Please don't judge me.
10566156,eng,The water came up to our knees.
2642612,eng,Tom realized what had happened.
3426288,eng,You don't have to do that either.
7120415,eng,The numbers speak for themselves.
7866220,eng,"In Algeria, 2019 hasn't been Bouteflika's happiest year."
7857805,eng,Do I have to open everything?
462424,eng,Shit.
6575391,eng,You're a big boy now.
3917145,eng,Please don't vote for him.
7197514,eng,It isn't rocket science.
7159825,eng,Tom should be about halfway to Australia by now.
2640150,eng,Tom and Mary seem to be in love with each other.
6926568,eng,This water never freezes.
1895606,eng,You're insane.
1026735,eng,Tom can't stay for long so let's get the meeting started.
2956974,eng,Tom hired an assistant.
6090831,eng,Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
7916020,eng,"For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Canaan in the very journey, and it was spring time: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem."
5669115,eng,Mary is making jam.
251021,eng,My watch is very accurate.
1764952,eng,Laurie was very kind.
8760414,eng,She feels bloated like a balloon.
5078403,eng,We're having guests tomorrow night.
8946263,eng,Can you fix this for me?
6094290,eng,I didn't think I was ever going to be this successful.
2361059,eng,I just can't believe this.
2544449,eng,"Did you say something, Tom?"
7543548,eng,Tom and Mary are younger than me.
7475636,eng,They realized they had to leave.
6665676,eng,"Tom was pleased, but Mary wasn't."
8989781,eng,Tom had no idea what to say in this situation.
3913522,eng,We'll never let them go.
8838461,eng,I spent some time with Tom.
8540362,eng,He headed to Algeria.
6474828,eng,We have only scratched the surface of Sami's story.
6461618,eng,Sami said that Layla was here.
7471818,eng,Tom and Mary say that they lost their keys.
4999924,eng,I thought that was fun.
2549294,eng,It was a bad job.
6532748,eng,Sami has never visited Egypt.
277577,eng,Let's have lunch!
6499671,eng,I don't think there's any reason why Tom and Mary have to do that.
8514548,eng,He isn't sure what to expect from her.
5229053,eng,Happy Birthday!
3826921,eng,I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon.
7296130,eng,Mary will come with me if she finishes her work.
327365,eng,"No, no. I mean to say that it has originality."
2547185,eng,I'm in perfect health.
7841321,eng,"I come from Kabylie, a region in northeastern Algeria."
7521005,eng,I think that that'll happen.
2502303,eng,I love Istanbul.
284753,eng,He didn't dare say anything.
3921101,eng,I haven't seen one of these since I was a kid.
6784609,eng,Tom drank a glass of milk and went back to bed.
243245,eng,I'll cook for you tonight.
9794018,eng,Yanni filed a suit against the bank.
7494146,eng,Where did he leave his shoes?
10181841,eng,Yemen's 2000-year-old Jewish community has come to an end on account of Houthi persecution.
65241,eng,Are we allowed to use the elevator?
2541930,eng,I'll try not to spill anything.
6663834,eng,I had no idea what was going on.
2359938,eng,I've made a mistake.
10076082,eng,Yanni is wrecking his own potential success.
8405441,eng,This would change everything.
7473139,eng,They say that they won't wait any longer.
5740693,eng,I entrusted my money to Tom.
8607080,eng,I'm not leaving Algeria without my spouse.
3824853,eng,I've finished my exams.
6348766,eng,I know both of Tom's sisters.
504362,eng,I'm going to meet a certain student.
300512,eng,He insured himself.
4016833,eng,Tom and John look like brothers.
329022,eng,Shall we take this outside?
6412184,eng,Mary read a book while she was waiting for the bus.
3085312,eng,The Polish language is interesting.
1710195,eng,I absolutely agree.
10231396,eng,Ziri was a teen.
6221398,eng,Tom has given me lots of things.
1853766,eng,She lied about it.
7757770,eng,Tell me more about Kabyle women.
10500799,eng,"Tom, will you answer the door?"
280905,eng,Practice volleying against two players.
287108,eng,What do you think of his attitude?
3273781,eng,Do you know anyone who knows about architecture?
7857236,eng,Is Algeria actually in danger?
6781732,eng,Why isn't Tom tired?
869063,eng,Two children are sitting on the fence.
312576,eng,She attained her success through hard work.
6653906,eng,Tom said that he had a terrible cold.
5600181,eng,I haven't finished eating yet.
3093666,eng,"You tricked Tom into coming here, didn't you?"
9732903,eng,What's the most challenging thing about learning a foreign language?
3736853,eng,I had a blackout.
7782985,eng,I find this book very interesting.
6660489,eng,I have absolutely nothing to do today.
8042423,eng,He's afraid of dentists.
7737035,eng,What's wrong with how I did it?
4567795,eng,You've got some balls coming here like this.
3938963,eng,Tom knows more about the world of his favorite video game than about the real world.
7732664,eng,Tom got out of prison in 2013.
7383524,eng,She chuckled quietly to herself.
10153550,eng,I think this river is too polluted to swim in.
2245576,eng,Hold me close.
6029096,eng,What do dragons eat?
7170868,eng,I know that Tom was your best friend.
2359754,eng,I've got to go to the police.
9483408,eng,Don't you think Tom is a genius?
5915458,eng,Tom has borrowed a lot of money from me.
6788734,eng,You should've seen Tom running.
6608779,eng,Tom ate a peanut butter sandwich.
6273371,eng,I'll do that as well.
7172276,eng,I thought that you'd like it.
266566,eng,A soft answer turneth away wrath.
243842,eng,Now the company can justify such expenditure.
6230669,eng,I can't do that now because I'm not feeling very well.
7171603,eng,I thought you said that I needed to do that.
7387562,eng,He didn't want his picture taken.
7406434,eng,They've decided to sell their cars.
7189767,eng,Sami called Layla but she didn't answer.
10718486,eng,He put on the backpack of sorrow which was heavy from its load.
6698898,eng,My plan is to go to Boston next summer.
10158613,eng,Yanni's car veered off the road and crashed.
4451726,eng,You were really annoyed with Mary.
8367417,eng,Tom is partially correct.
7274410,eng,That's tall.
3636079,eng,I'm all packed and ready to go.
8774088,eng,Is this a racquet?
9120644,eng,Yanni's sister was on her phone.
10765866,eng,Ziri never saw those people before.
5734291,eng,We're becoming too conceited.
8732357,eng,You mustn't walk there.
5386174,eng,Don't you have to go to school today?
6196210,eng,Tom kept still.
5357352,eng,I can't believe you did this.
1121910,eng,Who changed the subject?
7389012,eng,She's keeping her fingers crossed.
1994392,eng,He's a grouch.
3123489,eng,Would you like to come with me?
6311423,eng,This bra feels really nice.
8884554,eng,Foma is my younger brother.
8241358,eng,Some languages are on the verge of extinction.
8378464,eng,We had to have our car repaired.
6858741,eng,Mary gazed at her reflection in the glass.
9958608,eng,Yanni is our water balloon champion.
7514684,eng,I know that Tom and only Tom can do that.
2377488,eng,I like this job.
9553593,eng,We're going to have to think about everything.
7183072,eng,Tom and I are no longer living in Australia.
8178097,eng,All the boys in Mary's class think that she's cute.
6440059,eng,Tom is going to improve.
9768512,eng,Yanni is proving everyone wrong.
456519,eng,None of the children are sitting.
7276667,eng,Sami doesn't care who Layla is.
10532891,eng,Ziri hugged the palm tree.
3166137,eng,Tom is the one who woke me up.
6519551,eng,"Tom and Mary still do that, don't they?"
6507771,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom and Mary don't drink beer.
2818775,eng,Excuse me while I kiss this guy.
3299198,eng,Jane spent some time with Marie.
1870859,eng,You have many friends.
4014635,eng,Tom is a very lucky man.
7504633,eng,I know that Tom might get killed if he tries to do that.
3668763,eng,"My typewriter got broken; as a consequence, I borrowed my friend's."
6810315,eng,I told Tom that I was only joking.
7182742,eng,Tom said he didn't think that he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
2248825,eng,It was expected.
4823859,eng,Online banking is very convenient.
3161746,eng,Tom will help you if you ask.
1040566,eng,"Tom rolled out of bed at 6:30, shuffled into the kitchen and put two slices of bread into the toaster."
6492127,eng,Has anyone asked Tom and Mary why they did that?
4499612,eng,I have spent my whole life here.
7264300,eng,Sami said my name.
246476,eng,I owe it entirely to you that I have succeeded thus far.
8056532,eng,"And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went forth into the wilderness of Sur: and they marched three days through the wilderness, and found no water."
2964255,eng,My pain is excruciating.
6744631,eng,They have two cassette decks.
7521903,eng,I know Tom is patient.
9635604,eng,That was just a rhetorical question.
10589702,eng,The discussion was lively.
6261744,eng,I think Tom is sure that's what Mary has to do.
7400095,eng,He looked like he was shocked.
6241578,eng,Tom gets along well with his father-in-law.
8172551,eng,Was your name on the list of names that I gave you before?
5494258,eng,I saw Tom at the library.
60000,eng,This company manufactures televisions.
241890,eng,So far he has done very well at school.
8478515,eng,He's foolhardy.
6003752,eng,Tom and Mary had a fight because of me.
6657154,eng,Tom left Mary with John.
6253392,eng,Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him to do that.
6657873,eng,Which pair of shoes is Tom's?
7197421,eng,It isn't something that I'm very good at.
6866218,eng,I think that we're headed in the right direction.
2769799,eng,This material absorbs CO2.
7406901,eng,They're sitting in their car.
7741094,eng,Then the old queen had eight oysters fixed on to the princess's tail to show her high rank.
1019808,eng,"This is the day on which the Constitution's fundamental spirit, the sovereignty of the people, respect for fundamental human rights, and pacifism, are all reaffirmed."
7983275,eng,Sami works at that club.
7213013,eng,I put the milk back in the refrigerator.
5739365,eng,There are too many doubts.
5591233,eng,I need to change clothes.
8356491,eng,Don't forget about money.
10485307,eng,He refuses to come.
1520828,eng,Gotta catch 'em all.
8521560,eng,He isn't buying it and neither is she.
9988321,eng,Is she his wife?
4012983,eng,How did you persuade Tom to do that?
293734,eng,He set out on a lonely journey.
3672954,eng,External air conditioners are quite cheap.
6426573,eng,Mary said she'd do that for me.
7403838,eng,He knew that he could win.
66279,eng,How dare you speak to me like that!
4192681,eng,She was mocking the superficiality of fashion slaves.
2956565,eng,Tom didn't say a word all afternoon.
4500829,eng,Tell your wife every day that you love her.
6135875,eng,"She is very pretty, I mean, she is attractive and beautiful."
7440465,eng,They said they didn't feel hot.
5729577,eng,A little sleep will do you good.
6344000,eng,You'd better wait and see what happens.
2575704,eng,"Once we are airborne, you make unbuckle your seatbelts."
8110963,eng,I must do it again.
9143845,eng,Being human means being responsible.
9038194,eng,"Though he was frequently quoted in the media, Suga gained a reputation for having a low-key demeanor that generated little attention as a national political figure."
6665740,eng,"Tom was unlucky, but Mary wasn't."
6580409,eng,"Tom was spoiled by his parents, especially his mother."
8632953,eng,There are almost no planes flying in the sky.
3197679,eng,"What now? ..Hey, Edgeworth. Nice to see you. ""Likewise."" ""What brings you here?"" ""A friend of yours happens to be a client of mine."""
8513882,eng,She seems attracted to him.
8984947,eng,This could become quite interesting.
10778570,eng,Tom hasn't eaten anything in three days.
3619282,eng,It's a simple plan.
3448803,eng,Tom is good at playing tennis.
3637954,eng,What you decided to do is insane.
6268383,eng,Tom wondered where Mary could've gone.
9027237,eng,"Tom wasn't caught cheating, but everybody knew that he had cheated."
8180499,eng,Do you think that Tom and Mary will do that together?
7972396,eng,I'll give you enough money to buy what you need.
279206,eng,Could you tell me where I can get a train?
2890585,eng,"I'm much more relaxed driving during the off-peak hours, when the streets are empty."
8957465,eng,Tom won't be on duty tomorrow.
7850679,eng,Have you ever eaten anything that Tom's cooked?
2776288,eng,She has posters of her favorite bands on her walls.
4494602,eng,The audience is young.
7227775,eng,I don't think that you need to tell Tom you're going to do that.
10231702,eng,Ziri is eating dinner in the backyard.
2294027,eng,I believe I can help you.
6899001,eng,"Tom is like Mary, isn't he?"
5975523,eng,I fell from a tree.
7515323,eng,I know Tom didn't want to do that today.
10647691,eng,She has much greater command of language and uses a greater variety of words.
9762072,eng,Yanni destroyed Skura's family.
7861458,eng,Algeria buys weapons from Russia.
3183924,eng,I think Tom is immoral.
5205428,eng,I just got there as fast as I could.
6420894,eng,Mary said she was too young to do that.
7834041,eng,We want to protect both society and the environment.
6699068,eng,This is the same guitar that my father used to play when he was my age.
7179186,eng,Tom said that it's a common problem.
6220967,eng,I've tried to do that once.
65679,eng,"With Windows, you have to have extensions or it won't read your files."
6870319,eng,I wish I could have seen Tom.
2179161,eng,She didn't pay back the money.
4012778,eng,Don't talk to that guy over there.
3457429,eng,"The day when Europe ceases to speak its many languages is the day that Europe – as an idea, as a project – ceases to exist."
4752665,eng,I took pity on her and lent her the money.
9176572,eng,I won't apologize to Tom.
3500583,eng,The skeleton of Richard III was discovered under a parking lot.
7165440,eng,Sami was bored.
9105729,eng,Democracy is when a cow is allowed to choose who will milk her.
7229026,eng,I don't think that Tom was as generous as he should've been.
9109537,eng,Yanni asked Skura for a lift to Algiers.
6423512,eng,Mary forced herself to stay focused.
2249430,eng,Just hold still.
9361256,eng,Yanni lives in a very small town in southern Algeria.
3925439,eng,Tom met with Mary to discuss the current financial crisis at the company.
318478,eng,The patient finally conquered his illness.
4638958,eng,Computers didn't yet exist around that time.
10037977,eng,Eat this bread.
7381893,eng,Mary checked her messages.
7010442,eng,The main ingredient is sugar.
9810359,eng,I hope we can come up with a few good ideas.
7992306,eng,Sami anonymously reported the drug dealer.
7542405,eng,Tom was scared to go there by himself.
6513514,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were relieved.
3150595,eng,Tom bought this truck in Boston.
2408451,eng,I think we should all go inside.
5852096,eng,I have a ranch.
9719827,eng,He told them not to do that.
7465934,eng,Stop doubting me.
6246689,eng,I found the wallet I thought I'd lost.
3734469,eng,Tom wants me to go to Boston with him.
6469255,eng,Sami changed his mind about taking Layla with him.
10133896,eng,Tom wanted his son to be a doctor.
2542992,eng,I'm going to go check on Tom.
8353296,eng,The food pantry operates on private donations.
6445344,eng,Sami has a debt with me.
8466424,eng,We're not doing everything as well as we need to.
1354353,eng,I bought a VW bus.
8182196,eng,I can't believe that Tom made such a stupid mistake.
10017584,eng,Yanni forgot.
7391863,eng,He will change his mind again.
8381345,eng,Do you have any younger sisters?
7197450,eng,It isn't our fault.
6373901,eng,Your dad is having an affair with that slut.
7521416,eng,Tom knew Mary was at work.
6710712,eng,Tom was a normal kid.
3399600,eng,Bamboos are one of the fastest growing plants on the planet.
7212316,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary was biased.
8416796,eng,This pizza has four main ingredients.
10713733,eng,The days are flying by.
3914127,eng,I'm the one who killed her.
3452408,eng,Patience is a virtue that I can't afford.
10055148,eng,You have a high fever.
6376647,eng,How dare you fire one of my drivers?
9192632,eng,My reign is supreme.
6652986,eng,Tom said that he thought I might win.
7182270,eng,Tom said that he knew the reason why Mary wasn't able to do that.
4685145,eng,The engine is noisy.
7007002,eng,"O son, long trained in Ilian fates, he said, / this chance Cassandra, she alone, displayed. / Oft to Hesperia and Italia's reign / she called us."
7519646,eng,Tom knew that Mary was Canadian.
35203,eng,What is butter made of?
6989020,eng,Thai and foreign divers safely led the other eight youngsters out of the cave earlier in the week.
9194683,eng,There weren't many people in the pool.
2387519,eng,I need some guidance.
53830,eng,What Jane said made the atmosphere less tense.
10793206,eng,Kenneth Copeland is the new Uri Geller.
9412634,eng,Tom didn't answer immediately.
3920947,eng,Forget about them.
7505566,eng,I know that Tom might not do what he's supposed to do.
6496892,eng,Tom and Mary say they know how difficult it'll be to do that.
867817,eng,"If a man had 11 sheep and all but 9 died, how many sheep would he have left?"
5521262,eng,We only speak French at home.
291421,eng,I think he has enough intelligence to understand it.
10779672,eng,My master is living a life free from wordly cares.
270523,eng,The best time of life is when we are young.
10746798,eng,Tom couldn't understand Mary's anger.
6871216,eng,I can't wait to hear your side of the story.
10746616,eng,Tom needs to hear that from you.
694033,eng,The victim declined to press charges.
6259877,eng,"You don't like school, do you?"
6494347,eng,We have to make sure Tom and Mary know what they're supposed to do.
7442970,eng,They let us know that they had arrived.
6649756,eng,Tom said that he hopes Mary will be at the party.
6575233,eng,The doctor is on his way.
9982233,eng,What Tom said scared me.
6260070,eng,We've decided to leave Boston.
1025135,eng,Tom is a very fast swimmer.
9821860,eng,I told Tom he should buy a red sports car.
9089715,eng,Yanni put his shoes back on.
8845205,eng,I want to play tennis on Monday.
7196695,eng,Tom seemed surprised Mary didn't know what to do.
7475628,eng,They said that they liked pizza.
7397847,eng,He forged her father's signature.
8161083,eng,Who plays with fire ends up burned.
1723934,eng,It was impossible to pull out the cork.
6424585,eng,Mary says she has no other choice.
8549157,eng,She wasn't injured in the train wreck.
718032,eng,Few things can match the unmitigated fury of child preachers.
6225189,eng,Both Tom and I shouted as loudly as we could.
6728679,eng,Tom knows that you've spent time in prison.
5176995,eng,"I cook, but I don't enjoy it much."
1332072,eng,This shirt needs to be washed.
253576,eng,I will make use of this opportunity.
6537524,eng,"Shouldn't we invite Tom, too?"
5293150,eng,Tom's family congratulated him.
2537669,eng,"Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was."
4663890,eng,Schedules are difficult to coordinate.
3449429,eng,Tom has been asking for you.
3390668,eng,How do you plan to proceed?
4979573,eng,I have nothing to share.
2374850,eng,I knew Tom was shy.
10023067,eng,Yanni made Skura a hot cup of cocoa.
4498011,eng,Tom did really well.
6385815,eng,Sami knew Layla was looking for him.
6793025,eng,Tom went to Boston on business last month.
8910225,eng,She is talented.
10659826,eng,What would I have to do to get you to help me?
5263737,eng,Haven't you washed the dishes yet?
6498476,eng,Do you think that Tom and Mary can take care of themselves?
2011823,eng,Tom won't want to wait.
2735109,eng,I'll pay you a visit at home when it's the holidays.
8396096,eng,Your mother called.
7143702,eng,I didn't think that we could risk that.
5217307,eng,I still feel really tired.
10647767,eng,You're not tired.
3442198,eng,That's not all I learned.
7231272,eng,I don't think that Tom is being sarcastic.
6440027,eng,Tom said he felt scared.
1983095,eng,"She didn't visit me on Sunday, but on Monday."
6262881,eng,Tom says you've got a big mouth.
3908863,eng,I'll tell her that's not true.
5835767,eng,Are you getting me?
4404437,eng,You're all hypocritical.
6033138,eng,I have only one picture of great-grandmother.
387704,eng,Can I have a look at your newspaper?
8510701,eng,I've been in Boston for three months now.
1156229,eng,Give me five minutes to finish the last adjustments.
6517874,eng,I thought Tom and Mary weren't cold.
1361943,eng,They criticized me for coming late.
7182902,eng,I admit that I did what Tom told me not to do.
2254908,eng,Who's not coming?
7385896,eng,She put on her ice skates.
5909829,eng,I'm going to get home at about 2:30.
5839093,eng,I don't have any money in the safe.
8818074,eng,Yanni got help.
8934456,eng,I didn't know then that Tom would be my last hope.
6849241,eng,Please tell us what happened.
7379283,eng,Mary admitted she was frustrated.
10069530,eng,"When Yanni finished reading that book, he cried."
10110119,eng,Yanni needs to wait.
6242125,eng,I don't know what's going to happen next.
8768118,eng,"Methyl is a functional group containing a carbon bonded to three hydrogen atoms, -CH3."
3179689,eng,I should not have stayed up late yesterday.
9030421,eng,Skura is class president.
6705981,eng,Sami packed up his things.
3821621,eng,Why are you wearing short pants?
7406629,eng,They always carry books with them.
3732157,eng,I've got to be somewhere at 2:30.
7531987,eng,Hear ye!
8340488,eng,Tom didn't see who was behind Mary.
10051924,eng,"I'm not mad at you, since I never expected much from you anyways."
6336629,eng,I wonder whether Tom really did what he said he did.
3733186,eng,Remind me to stop by the supermarket on the way home.
9088512,eng,There's a rumor that he likes you.
3423975,eng,What's the minimum salary in Sierra Leone?
7397012,eng,He says he needs to talk to you.
9463095,eng,"Palestinians are human beings, too."
6898776,eng,"Tom is in bed, isn't he?"
5747268,eng,That was the last time.
7539756,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has anything to apologize for.
8098288,eng,I woke up dizzy. I had the worst nightmare.
3622947,eng,"In 1996, the name of Victoria Terminus was changed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus."
6245692,eng,"You knew I should do that, didn't you?"
8030665,eng,I'll buy you a Kabyle dress on our way to Kabylie.
7506438,eng,Tom won't tell Mary that she needs to do that today.
6846764,eng,Tom heard the floorboards creaking.
9844445,eng,It's more nuanced than that.
7522011,eng,I know Tom is a bum.
8456632,eng,Tom bought his dog some toys.
6860697,eng,I don't have any plans for today.
7748720,eng,Berber is the language of my parents.
9346534,eng,That's Tom's granddaughter.
6260566,eng,Tom said that would happen soon.
2244642,eng,Is Tom sure?
6527197,eng,Tom wanted to know if you'll be ready by 2:30.
473605,eng,"She won't leave the room, because she doesn't want to catch another cold."
7515698,eng,"No one invited Tom, but he came anyway."
8233174,eng,Take a step back from the situation and try to figure out what's going on.
9288771,eng,"Kieran Tuntivate broke the 4-minute mile in February 2020, the first ever at Harvard University, and held a grade-point average between 3.6 and 3.7 on a scale where 4.0 is the highest."
7027923,eng,There are many famous paintings in Rome.
3387183,eng,A dog does not take money for his trot.
5939656,eng,Tom never says hello.
6213115,eng,"She then gave him a pipe, a honeycomb, and a scrip of deer skin, but she dared not speak her mind, for she suspected that he loved Chloe since he was always in the latter's company."
950252,eng,This will not please Daddy.
4845365,eng,I'd like to build an eco-friendly house.
1394044,eng,"It's important, so I'll do it."
46057,eng,Good care should be taken of the pearl.
6244917,eng,Tom was just trying to protect his kids.
3671465,eng,Some people clung to tree branches for several hours to avoid being washed away by the floodwaters.
296452,eng,He is Japanese to the bone.
3734913,eng,I shouldn't have played outside in the rain.
3911224,eng,I'm totally over her.
906867,eng,What's your favorite saying?
7248681,eng,Sami will be doing a group Skype meeting.
875701,eng,He arrived at midnight.
10148281,eng,Why don't we drink one more bottle of wine?
7508862,eng,I didn't know that Tom didn't do that by mistake.
433499,eng,Wash your face and hands.
1070885,eng,They've missed the boat.
6411098,eng,Mary just told me that she wouldn't be here tomorrow.
6348250,eng,Didn't you go to school yesterday?
6934245,eng,That wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
5853153,eng,I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
7380478,eng,Mary got yelled at by her boss.
923367,eng,Koreans don't like coriander.
243216,eng,Today's dinner is fish.
9448035,eng,We will do it one more time.
1969241,eng,I was with friends all last night.
9149654,eng,"Could you stop at the corner there, please?"
6604328,eng,"Sea lions are brown, bark loudly, “walk"" on land using their large flippers and have visible ear flaps."
7517699,eng,I know that Tom knows what Mary did.
9817667,eng,Yanni loved watching car racing.
6232172,eng,Tell Tom not to do that.
5165750,eng,I didn't drink much.
573907,eng,There was jam in the electric outlet.
10638180,eng,Don't you care to know who killed your brother?
6829817,eng,Provided that the fire department doesn't come to us!
6271921,eng,"Tom won't do that, but Mary will."
8900861,eng,Tom wants people to know about that.
8869295,eng,Free cheese can only be found inside a trap.
7512450,eng,I know Tom knows why you want us to do that.
1658007,eng,She didn't get caught.
3181459,eng,You'll have to talk to Tom.
9105242,eng,We cried.
9707126,eng,Long live the Revolution!
4778644,eng,We are experienced.
6883760,eng,I'll go if you won't go.
5747381,eng,Tom was in good spirits.
3620496,eng,Would you carry this down to the second floor for me?
8253272,eng,"If you do this, you'll go to paradise."
328218,eng,A gift of cheesecake is apparently good to soothe discord.
7404451,eng,She bought what she wanted.
8733209,eng,He was washing in a public washroom.
42429,eng,It is effective against bacterial infections.
6255052,eng,Tom swept the room with the new broom Mary had given him.
4081435,eng,Do I really need to write it explicitly?
6064302,eng,Tom was shocked when I told him what had happened.
7178366,eng,Tom said that Mary knew that John might not have to do that this year.
6343931,eng,I can't just leave you here by yourself.
3730064,eng,It was for Tom and Mary.
8341126,eng,It doesn't usually take this long.
6676765,eng,I like figs more than I should say.
3248485,eng,Tom ordered some food.
2026629,eng,Why on earth would you want to go there?
2642337,eng,Tom needs to know where Mary is.
7817988,eng,"And the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him."
5287809,eng,My room is a complete mess.
7414472,eng,Sami believed in an all-powerful god.
5011414,eng,Who knows what it was?
289915,eng,He graduated from high school this spring.
8420297,eng,When was it you went to Boston?
1526442,eng,The old man spoke with me in French.
6264725,eng,I know it isn't a good idea.
1520384,eng,It’s a different beast.
3921129,eng,You won't believe what Tom told me.
10127496,eng,"When I found him, he was mumbling a children's ditty."
5879230,eng,Layla had this attraction to men.
302434,eng,He received much applause.
21267,eng,Have fun.
6423231,eng,Mary said she tried to do that once.
3726899,eng,You sure have a way with words.
8575734,eng,Tom started yelling at me.
6514226,eng,Tom and Mary can leave early if they want to.
7540271,eng,Tom will be speaking in Boston on October 20th.
9966974,eng,Yanni unscrewed the light switch.
1026665,eng,Tom comes here every other day.
4256017,eng,I like to learn languages.
6654359,eng,Tom said that he didn't want to ever do that again.
10243514,eng,Ziri is getting the names mixed up.
6257606,eng,I certainly won't do that again.
535567,eng,She's a rather rare individual.
262041,eng,I accommodated my friend with money.
3329939,eng,I doubt if Tom would see it that way.
7374674,eng,Mary said that she'd be willing to go.
1121864,eng,Give the house to my daughter.
6924257,eng,I seldom see Tom anymore.
317227,eng,She doesn't like baseball very much.
6526992,eng,Tom is struggling to pay back his student loans.
298973,eng,He carried on with his experiment.
2539568,eng,I was drinking heavily in those days.
7130475,eng,Tom doesn't seem to find that annoying.
813423,eng,I don't like your friends at all.
8513214,eng,She doesn't like eating vegetables.
2054013,eng,"When he's hungry, Marco is capable of wolfing down a kilogram of baked goods."
3122467,eng,Objects of the preposition are always a what?
6709067,eng,Sami returned to the immigration office.
6539380,eng,Layla's right nipple was cut off.
249686,eng,Play Chopin for me.
6434884,eng,Tom said that Mary studies French a lot.
6583567,eng,I lost my wedding ring while snorkeling.
1887838,eng,I told Tom to go home.
7737497,eng,You made fools of yourselves.
5745984,eng,We didn't play our best.
10610812,eng,Ziri and Rima slept under the stars.
6438075,eng,You'll just have to be patient.
9419996,eng,"Tom wasn't the only one who was asleep. Mary was asleep, too."
20572,eng,How many pens are there on the desk?
10457437,eng,I didn't know Tom lived in a dorm.
6335999,eng,I'd have done that if I'd known how.
1098723,eng,Where is Mary?
2538864,eng,Tom became flustered and a bit nervous.
281983,eng,Let's over the matter before accepting it.
258066,eng,"I like poets, such as Takuboku."
6261244,eng,Tom is quite optimistic about it.
1712930,eng,Many students like to study in the morning.
27750,eng,I'll be back within an hour.
9101857,eng,Tom left the theater before the play was over.
5228930,eng,Oh crap!
8169645,eng,The future is far ahead.
5904857,eng,I don't want to drive to Boston by myself.
3907654,eng,Go and apologize to her.
958889,eng,Life worked out.
2243286,eng,They play basketball.
8500144,eng,Languages have difficult words.
6041653,eng,You might want to change into something more comfortable.
6245969,eng,I thought Tom was going to be late.
2406323,eng,I should check on that.
2079799,eng,Lie down on the examination table.
6528882,eng,Tom said that he was really confused.
6237794,eng,Tom says he can't really recall what happened.
776026,eng,"At last, my elder sister got married."
7191534,eng,I went to Australia with Tom.
9590075,eng,The street's crowded.
4629776,eng,The police questioned Tom again.
9810276,eng,I certainly do hope that you've learned your lesson.
7199017,eng,It's not Tom who needs to do that. It's me.
7232626,eng,I don't think that Tom can do that without my help.
8250158,eng,I really hate it when people stare at me.
4328675,eng,Are you going in costume this year?
6510177,eng,What'll Tom and Mary do when they get to Boston?
4495729,eng,Tom has been arrested again.
1024231,eng,Tom says he can't put up with the heat any longer.
6254165,eng,Tom has been here many times before.
326759,eng,"Though it's now January, it's warm like early spring."
3500590,eng,Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
6340579,eng,Please let Tom do whatever he wants to do.
65115,eng,"I'm fine, thank you."
5284416,eng,"Your car is fast, but mine is even faster."
5921386,eng,You can't all come in.
2957917,eng,Tom received a fax from Mary this morning.
9171562,eng,What Yanni wants is your love.
7552568,eng,They were washing the sand off their feet.
6223026,eng,Tom actually was very busy that day.
7384021,eng,She said that this belonged to her.
6528696,eng,Tom is still wearing his wedding ring.
6825534,eng,I prefer winter holidays.
6803651,eng,I only did that because I had nothing better to do.
6048653,eng,Do you want to know what happens?
3819096,eng,This is an equilateral triangle.
308794,eng,She has a bad habit of talking a long time on the phone.
10016762,eng,We've known each other for so long.
26400,eng,"Do you swim very fast, too?"
3813020,eng,Sometimes it can't be avoided.
5444096,eng,This first question is for you.
7236368,eng,I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary why he's going to Boston.
2082357,eng,Is this as far as you're going?
6807213,eng,Sami was so terrified.
7237403,eng,Sami knew what weed looked like.
51719,eng,Everybody is equal before the law.
388867,eng,There's a rumor going around that she got a new job.
6504591,eng,What do you think Tom and Mary were talking about?
6126774,eng,Tom has lots of strange ideas.
8373025,eng,Tom will be on the same plane I'll be on.
7380912,eng,Mary admitted she was starved.
5651255,eng,The truth is that it disgusts me.
7113804,eng,I was very frustrated.
2543013,eng,I'm glad you see it that way.
8813978,eng,Can I lay on the sofa?
9609807,eng,I've never seen Tom play baseball.
309771,eng,"Her sister I like very much, but her brother I do not like."
307021,eng,They lost the battle.
6268428,eng,Tom told Mary why he couldn't do that.
2387531,eng,I need some time with Tom.
10539777,eng,There are Japanese full of body hair.
9189225,eng,I can do that job on my own.
2123617,eng,It happens.
2952338,eng,I may not be able to help.
6148983,eng,Sami began to notice strange things.
6628136,eng,Tom ate a cheesesteak sandwich.
10221335,eng,I get the gist of it.
1037420,eng,Are you all listening to me?
6352798,eng,Tom seemed a little worried.
6267216,eng,Will you do that tomorrow?
2672071,eng,Tom decided to live by taking the absurdity of life to its full conclusion.
258015,eng,I ran a splinter into my finger.
10506170,eng,We may never know the answer.
8257916,eng,This word doesn't exist in Berber.
2709895,eng,Tom drew a picture of a dolphin.
294179,eng,He was far from thankful to his former teacher.
9495793,eng,I'd never seen so many stopped cars.
7439815,eng,They said that they were all alone.
315061,eng,She took off her coat.
2042115,eng,He stepped into the lion's den.
997798,eng,There wasn't anybody in that room.
867291,eng,Every mistake made me stronger.
5737773,eng,This caught us by surprise.
6347681,eng,Tom wouldn't have done any better.
288835,eng,He had never studied English before he went to the United States.
4633390,eng,I don't use Facebook.
10631372,eng,Reading about something you find really interesting in the language you want to learn makes the learning process a lot faster and easier.
297043,eng,He is absorbed in his work.
7184514,eng,I don't have many friends here in Australia.
10344220,eng,They came home from school.
6418819,eng,Mary didn't get paid for the work she did.
6237541,eng,You should've asked Tom to do that for you.
6881737,eng,"Tom isn't a happy camper, is he?"
10142335,eng,Your neighbor's rich.
1637646,eng,I got what I needed.
6409915,eng,Mary wishes she could speak French as well as Tom does.
7975948,eng,Your help is becoming more and more necessary for me!
6654921,eng,Tom said that he didn't have to get up early tomorrow.
10509069,eng,The tires on my car are almost bald.
7644717,eng,She came running up.
10670892,eng,"There was a noise, then grinding, and then it was quiet again."
3428427,eng,You're just the person we've been looking for.
627218,eng,Facebook eats up a lot of my time.
6013301,eng,I think we've learned a little bit from Tom.
6660881,eng,I'm not the same person I used to be.
8058254,eng,Mennad is wearing his vest.
1875812,eng,I love dessert.
6646473,eng,Tom told me I should consider resigning.
5848529,eng,Tom doesn't have a lot of money.
8575009,eng,He was stroking his camel.
10681815,eng,I think Tom doesn't like talking about himself.
9041829,eng,"NEFU is considered the premier center for research into woolly mammoths and other prehistoric, ice age species."
6474302,eng,Sami had an affair.
1392484,eng,Is that the key you're looking for?
7736144,eng,I could convince Tom not to do that.
281409,eng,In Japan women assume the greater load of responsibility for childcare.
8175742,eng,He's sure.
8177567,eng,I don't really think that Tom wants to do that.
9821865,eng,You're trusted by every one of us.
7181070,eng,I want you to come visit us in Australia next summer.
6506966,eng,I'm not satisfied that Tom and Mary are guilty.
6337469,eng,I think I'm better at French than you.
293100,eng,He came near being run over by a car.
8390866,eng,He's a fireman.

245842,eng,I always got up early in my childhood.
8799714,eng,"In Algeria, people don't worship the president."
10703329,eng,"Its scope ranges from the common mistakes to the approach to the tasks, from the tips on group work to the detailed description of the exam preparation: all this to help you finish your studies successfully."

10044920,eng,That isn't completely wrong.
6265515,eng,"You like reggae, don't you?"
1359478,eng,Well I'll be darned!
6907730,eng,Does Tom play golf?
8599368,eng,Hand washing is more effective against the coronavirus than face masks.
6392407,eng,This is the happiest day of my life.
4256462,eng,The Professor gave a lecture on solar energy yesterday. I gave a lecture on Relative Risk.
9635862,eng,They'll let me do whatever I want.
5909553,eng,He's very good at it.
6497219,eng,Tom and Mary answered all the questions that John asked them.
468719,eng,How dare you speak like that to your elders and betters!
1117113,eng,How does he make the report clear to read?
6512595,eng,Tom and Mary said they've finished doing that.
32048,eng,I don't know what Mary is looking for.
72715,eng,March 15 will be my last day of school.
8637434,eng,Camel milk is good for people with diabetes.
8239252,eng,I demand that he leave forthwith.
10268676,eng,"He'll be back in a couple of hours. In the meantime, let's make dinner."
7321165,eng,Sami went there for me.
9414669,eng,Gorillas very rarely climb trees.
8058448,eng,"Mennad was really, really tired that day."
1408829,eng,Eat snow.
2648641,eng,We could all die.
8983664,eng,He's now working in the town centre.
2295681,eng,This is ours.
4540055,eng,The bite of this spider causes intense pain.
255557,eng,I hid myself under the bed.
8818172,eng,Yanni doesn't use body wash.
8513416,eng,He'll sit with her.
10627666,eng,Ziri just got a bad sunburn as a kid.
8392915,eng,Why don't you join us for dessert?
2662937,eng,I was talking about the problem with Tom.
7397132,eng,He said that he was really poor.
5695970,eng,Where in Helsinki do you live?
9701857,eng,We need to repair this roof again.
10528641,eng,"In short, she had no idea if he'd live."

3958484,eng,John Couch Adams was born in England in 1819. He was born to a farming family.
10231448,eng,Ziri invited Rima for a Martini.

3735242,eng,We may as well all go.
1092597,eng,Tom used to be a special education teacher.
3651703,eng,I returned home at seven o'clock.
7130628,eng,Tom had never smoked marijuana before.
5736287,eng,We have to cross the street.
7240246,eng,I think you know that we have to help Tom do that.
6790063,eng,We'll have to try something else.
6927928,eng,"Tom is worried about Mary, isn't he?"
2007746,eng,Let's look upstairs.
2662691,eng,There's another problem we haven't discussed yet.
574163,eng,He's being accused of kidnapping.
6442400,eng,I heard you arguing.
10747458,eng,I don't know English well.
2485287,eng,This crate contains apples.
6480123,eng,Never change anything!
6125449,eng,I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that.
2733235,eng,He attacked me from the rear.
22707,eng,We argued him into going.
9921893,eng,I find it very cute.
10612405,eng,"I'll be there, don't worry."
9628406,eng,We've had this kind of problem before.
1834156,eng,I wonder how Tom will get out of that mess.
2208454,eng,Can't you leave me alone?
2729345,eng,He raises Arabian horses.
7399291,eng,She wishes she had a bigger car.
10019641,eng,That isn't the right answer.
6499797,eng,I think Tom and Mary are the only ones who don't want to do that.
7110827,eng,I think Tom is flustered.
3415151,eng,Tom seems moody.
6118494,eng,It isn't that hard.
6484105,eng,"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character."
9713911,eng,I don't need to talk to anyone else.
6662356,eng,Tom became very discouraged.
1164463,eng,Tom left work early.
3094552,eng,Do you really think Tom would lie about something like that?
10216019,eng,Ziri can start cooking.
7239960,eng,Didn't you know Tom isn't planning to do that?
5414046,eng,I haven't played this game before.
7197706,eng,It isn't like I really want to go to Boston.
8833836,eng,I think Tom can wait.
6480891,eng,It's hard to be modest when you're the best.
6341714,eng,That's not the way you should be doing that.
7584722,eng,Tom asked Mary to help him out.
6497388,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they forgot all about the meeting.
70779,eng,Does every boy have to learn cooking in your school?
2957287,eng,Tom is the one who wanted to get here early.
6231958,eng,"You didn't learn how to do that from Tom, did you?"
7748540,eng,The separatists are hypocrites.
8713526,eng,"Hubble is revolutionizing modern astronomy, not only for scientists, but also by taking the public on a wondrous journey of exploration and discovery."
9981717,eng,From father to son.
327480,eng,I suddenly got a craving to eat some crisp roast chicken skin.
7839160,eng,This is separatist propaganda.
315803,eng,"She is fair, fat and forty."
6507814,eng,Tom and Mary didn't know because I never told them.
2470524,eng,She lay in his arms all night.
6502175,eng,Is it true that Tom and Mary have never been to Boston?
6232045,eng,"You only did that because you had no choice, right?"
296019,eng,He wrote away for a sample.
6448415,eng,Sami was the foreman at the construction site.
5671859,eng,Mary is a midwife.
7540467,eng,Tom won't be able to come over this afternoon.
6414985,eng,Mary admitted that she'd stolen money from Tom.
7245722,eng,Sami didn't allow his roommate to use his fridge.
6519766,eng,I knew Tom and Mary weren't happy.
3320712,eng,Do you think he did it?
7402478,eng,She did all she could to help.
2012638,eng,I don't want to bother Tom.
9670136,eng,A cold wind blows.
5521395,eng,Tom will be here for a few days.
7237973,eng,Sami drove to the hospital.
6124832,eng,Tom already knows what needs to be done.
1155829,eng,We should be on our way.
6532724,eng,Sami was proud to show off his car.
10746186,eng,"Mary never behaved like a prima donna, but instead gave people the feeling that they were like her, the nice girl next door. It went down well with people."
6223542,eng,I had planned on doing that yesterday.
5393525,eng,"Landmines kill 15,000 to 20,000 people every year, many of them children."
9019012,eng,Mary likes her new dress.
7111355,eng,I don't think that Tom knows who he should ask to help him.
73058,eng,"There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, fall and winter."
5756278,eng,I can't surf.
292320,eng,He made a lot of money in New York and went back to the small town where he was born.
6498177,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't intend to ever do that again.
7520727,eng,Tom caught more fish than me.
6126698,eng,Maybe we should do that.
1495194,eng,This is Tom's canary.
6517804,eng,Tom and Mary say that they can swim well.
2778182,eng,Tom dodged Mary's surprise kiss.
3726443,eng,Tom is currently in danger.
2538103,eng,I'll pick up a loaf of bread on my way home.
5879554,eng,Fadil has other plans.
2870262,eng,"You have a son, don't you?"
6357831,eng,Tom looked offended.
7470264,eng,Tom and Mary said what they meant.
6414499,eng,Mary used to love Tom. Now she can't stand him.
7512291,eng,I know that Tom might have to do that today.
3131867,eng,Tom sounds upset.
7520979,eng,Tom knew Mary was at school.
6482163,eng,No one is doubting your courage.
2259765,eng,We have to notify the police.
6713058,eng,Sami didn't finish the job.
2335909,eng,Tom fell off his chair.
6507408,eng,Tom and Mary said they wished you wouldn't do that.
7155006,eng,Tom said that he'd never been to Australia.
3527938,eng,"Tom broke up with Mary last summer, but now he wants to get back together with her."
4025655,eng,They agreed that you should choose the track and establish the goal.
30046,eng,I'm glad you could come to the party.
3903388,eng,Why don't I stay with him?
1092460,eng,Tom wants to get a part-time job.
6423525,eng,Mary doesn't look like she's lonely.
7402976,eng,She said she was comfortable.
6055625,eng,"In recent years, some Muslim countries have prospered and attracted the attention of the world."
10682283,eng,I don't swim as well as Tom does.
7241795,eng,Sami hasn't cut his hair since he was six.
4374635,eng,Tom has no will power.
10044929,eng,That's something we can all hope for.
7337263,eng,What bad luck was this?
3912117,eng,I met them at the coffee shop.
6519858,eng,How do Tom and Mary know all this?
6229850,eng,Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't want to do that.
7972133,eng,I can't pass this exam. It's too hard.
2643502,eng,Tom was my dance instructor.
2643031,eng,It was nice chatting with you.
9695904,eng,"That's not possible, is it?"
6020560,eng,He is very intelligent.
9935552,eng,I have a bottle of beer in my backpack.
275782,eng,I call out in a loud voice but there is no reply.
6666318,eng,I got here at about 2:30.
6824756,eng,The city was filled with panic.
7270701,eng,Sami has been there over six hours.
2276251,eng,I don't understand you people.
6419289,eng,Mary said she thought Tom was interested.
9705836,eng,That's not the deal we made.
2361986,eng,I've got someplace I need to be.
9188929,eng,"I'm sorry, I overslept."
21550,eng,Our school begins at eight.
7177386,eng,Tom said that Mary was too out of shape to go mountain climbing.
260488,eng,I gave him a book.
288694,eng,He intended to persist in his silence.
2267921,eng,That's exactly what I used to think.
283604,eng,What he said may well be true.
7388719,eng,"He's in his tent, isn't he?"
7235720,eng,I don't think anybody really knows the real me.
3373266,eng,This car doesn't belong to me.
7926264,eng,I heard a loud noise.
7506492,eng,Tom really thought that Mary didn't have to do that.
6647201,eng,Tom told Mary he's seen that movie three times.
10674161,eng,You've done nothing to convince me otherwise.
10750084,eng,How many alphabets exist?
8353503,eng,I think that it's time for me to go back to work.
5990328,eng,Tom was still alive when we found him.
4474243,eng,I think there must be much gold in the depths of the Earth.
2057817,eng,I don't blame you for hating me.
8001198,eng,Mennad's messages were sexual.
4016344,eng,Tom goes for a walk every morning with his dog.
29422,eng,Rome has a lot of ancient buildings.
6445374,eng,Sami criticized the Pope.
9956345,eng,Yanni can work more than four hours a day.
2648761,eng,Share it with us.
6530702,eng,Tom used to be a car mechanic.
307029,eng,They warned the ship of the danger.
2642232,eng,You'll feel better after a bath.
1025332,eng,Tom has no interest in politics.
10751370,eng,The stage coach was held up by several men wearing masks.
10136726,eng,Let's talk about Algeria's political life.
773474,eng,"Do you have a brother, Pedro?"
5658264,eng,Nature provides all that I need.
8573944,eng,Mediocre developers don't aware of new technologies.
3072669,eng,Tom doesn't seem to think he needs to go to the hospital.
2392574,eng,I remember mentioning it once or twice.
10088231,eng,Bouteflika granted himself dictatorial powers.
8476094,eng,He's got a tan.
46184,eng,The information counts for much to us.
8225558,eng,She had an excellent idea.
6733182,eng,I wasn't so busy today.
7738932,eng,I needed him.
8290349,eng,It's a good thing we finished early.
39030,eng,Stop beating on the door!
2040352,eng,I'm glad you're to visit Tokyo next month.
2723859,eng,The Cannes International Film Festival is the most prestigious film festival in the world.
7217760,eng,Tom denied he was the one who told Mary to do that.
6211547,eng,"He mounted his horse, and with his faithful hound went on seeking further adventures through the world."
6796786,eng,Was Tom surprised to see Mary?
9594386,eng,You're undoubtedly the best swimmer here.
8792409,eng,Yanni didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.
3652051,eng,Did you do that of your own free will?
6375739,eng,Sami cares about his stepchildren.
311873,eng,What does she do?
1193529,eng,Her waist is about as wide as one of his arms!
2202632,eng,You're brilliant.
5288885,eng,"Where are you running, little hare?"
6048374,eng,Did you really think Tom was going be here today?
7201965,eng,Sami was very close to me.
5869226,eng,Fadil tossed the gun in a neighbor's backyard.
4995259,eng,"If you are surprised by how much time I have on my hands, I can assure you that this is not the case."
7791068,eng,Life is a continuous back and forth.
1027412,eng,"It doesn't make much sense to me, but Tom has decided not to go to college."
8040457,eng,Baya wears small bras.
6134964,eng,Sami was about to play the biggest show of his career.
752444,eng,How's your wife doing?
7521616,eng,I know Tom isn't a rebel.
289221,eng,He is always seeking for fame and wealth.
6508198,eng,Tom and Mary told me they were sick of doing that.
3729817,eng,Tom cried uncontrollably.
6138862,eng,I don't like those urchins.

9931110,eng,Yanni felt tired.
7396548,eng,He didn't deny he didn't do that.

7362896,eng,The mouse cooks fish.
63179,eng,"Our captain got sick, so I attended the meeting in his place."

254168,eng,I was very much surprised at the news.
1154179,eng,We like when you dance!

6863264,eng,Tom fell asleep at the wheel and caused an accident.
4665147,eng,"We're concerned about it, too."
7402324,eng,"She likes reggae, doesn't she?"
2247580,eng,I will stay.
3831730,eng,My neck does hurt a little.
6247671,eng,My dogs killed one of Tom's cats.
10108238,eng,Yanni's apartment is so hot the second you walk into it.
7174411,eng,I thought that I'd lost you forever.
2767207,eng,"I don't have a cat, and I never had one! — ""But yes, you had one. Why are you lying then?"""
3426227,eng,Tom is a pretty good driver.
6884200,eng,Is this the stuff Tom wants?
8200602,eng,I think you can help me with this.
7164496,eng,I should've refused to go to Australia.
5848391,eng,How well do you think Tom did?
1628393,eng,Let's celebrate!
7402735,eng,He should pay what he owes.
4664303,eng,This bicycle used to belong to Tom.
6423648,eng,I think Mary really enjoyed herself.
2613920,eng,I am now learning Esperanto.
2323189,eng,I don't think Tom likes you.
2639976,eng,Tom said he needed three hundred thousand dollars.
4935551,eng,I guess I'm in big trouble.
245810,eng,Even children need to make sense of the world.
6655328,eng,I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
7198655,eng,It isn't as hot in June as it is in July.
5507200,eng,We're now doing just that.
5969238,eng,The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.
16086,eng,You are welcome to the use of my yacht.
2932692,eng,We want the government to serve the entire population.
5106383,eng,Tom couldn't trust Mary.
243860,eng,Recently I have had no appetite.
6341065,eng,I'd talk to Tom about that if I were you.
732558,eng,He and I want to dance a lot and go for a walk.
2325783,eng,I expect you to be there.
7728420,eng,Dominic Grieve has tabled a motion for a second referendum.
1189863,eng,"I speak Japanese a little, but I'm not good at it, yet."
60705,eng,Hold this ladder steady.
1112037,eng,It's all part of the plan.
536549,eng,"I met your mother through Facebook. So, if Facebook didn't exist, neither would you, my little angel."
9272365,eng,I've heard that Tom is a good cook.
2839428,eng,What's the first thing you did when you woke up this morning?
10242877,eng,Do you wanna fuck?
327097,eng,The confusion beggars description.
7160524,eng,Sami was the nicest man ever.
1316554,eng,"He tried to make his wife happy, but he couldn't."
1961701,eng,I thought you thought Tom wasn't interested in sports.
7538003,eng,Tom is happy that Mary came.
7543353,eng,Tom asked me a bunch of questions.
10653609,eng,Life is continually renewing itself.
9732516,eng,They have three children: two sons and a daughter.
1311699,eng,Everybody must know.
2538738,eng,I'd like nothing better than to do that.
2729892,eng,I can fix the heater.
3928023,eng,"The sergeant was the first who went mad, while the lieutenant simply hanged himself."
370736,eng,I passed by four houses.
23438,eng,"From our point of view, his proposal is reasonable."
483444,eng,We didn't see her anywhere.
310784,eng,She divided the cake into five pieces.
6339183,eng,I'm not much better at doing that than Tom is.
304877,eng,He is a methodical person.
7983678,eng,I'm going on vacation this summer.
1483798,eng,"I had a slight headache, so I went to bed early."
1092637,eng,Tom tried to break up the fight.
2324042,eng,Her father is a brewer.
10201801,eng,I'm tired of school cafeteria food.
9740064,eng,I really want to learn Japanese too.
6413180,eng,Mary told me that she thought Tom was frustrated.
10356007,eng,You've got to talk to Ziri.
9496121,eng,I need your protection.
3308385,eng,I can't picture Tom in a dress.
6440345,eng,It rained all weekend.
6519782,eng,I hope Tom and Mary get here soon.
8935542,eng,You have forgotten your umbrella.
2431666,eng,He doesn't run.
436835,eng,I need an analgesic.
6257127,eng,Tom said Mary needs to do that before John gets here.
2923172,eng,"How did you get in here? ""I climbed in through the window."""
8495443,eng,He doesn't know what else to say.
7236289,eng,I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
10203360,eng,I didn't read all Tom's messages.
2859605,eng,Mary fixed it.
3822918,eng,I believe in love.
1094176,eng,Tom entered the room with his gun drawn.
70511,eng,How do you pronounce your last name?
7791634,eng,I can't go along with Tom's plan.
3853778,eng,I prefer to sit in the front row near the window next to Tom.
7381618,eng,"Mary is waiting, isn't she?"
5860560,eng,I opened the trunk.
7704635,eng,"I was planning to do that, but I never got the chance."
3723784,eng,This all adds up to one thing.
5270059,eng,Can I ask him something?
5401553,eng,"I don't think it'll rain, but I'll take an umbrella with me, just in case."
8884376,eng,Hold your bloody horses.
8160537,eng,"I'm not looking for a map of Poland, but the whole of Europe."
6348525,eng,Tom told me you wouldn't do that.
9032028,eng,It'd be good if you could come with us.
7985501,eng,Why did you put so much pepper in the stew?
10076019,eng,Yanni kept feelings those things.
7741277,eng,Tom's activism didn't seem to have any identifiable effect.
22816,eng,We must think about the community.
6655951,eng,Tom listened carefully to Mary's explanation.
6489805,eng,Where do Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston?
3260065,eng,I missed the departmental meeting because I was sick.
5740710,eng,It's all about the timing.
5250556,eng,I had a hard time saying no.
5293948,eng,Tom died before his son was born.
909570,eng,Spend your time wisely and you'll always have enough of it.
7632233,eng,Where did you ladies learn Berber?
3492731,eng,There's a rumor going around that Tom likes Mary.
9199661,eng,There's a lot of stars to see at night in summer.
6178313,eng,Sami is gonna have a baby with Layla.
300834,eng,He promised me to come early.
6416507,eng,Mary didn't tell Tom she was going to Boston.
6361451,eng,Sami routinely spoke with Layla on the phone.
247069,eng,My son had been writing for several hours when I entered the room.
7819911,eng,"To be honest, he doesn't have any musical talent."
716497,eng,You're telling me.
5734666,eng,Tom shook his head and smiled.
10234676,eng,Ziri watched that video.
8276837,eng,Scorpions can kill people.
1030237,eng,At 2:00 a.m. he finally found the solution.
2272419,eng,Tom didn't need lessons.
1740774,eng,"Strasbourg is also an ideal starting point for excursions across the Rhine, to châteaux nestling in the heart of vineyards, villages perching on the mountainside between lakes and forests, and other delights."
6646107,eng,Tom's parents let Tom stay out late at night.
261331,eng,I cannot praise her enough.
6783727,eng,"Two towering crags, twin giants, guard the cove, / and threat the skies. The waters at their feet / sleep hushed, and, like a curtain, frowns above, / mixt with the glancing green, the darkness of the grove."
6235284,eng,Tom would never try to do that without some help.
8241046,eng,I think that that's exactly what Tom is expecting to do.
8224981,eng,Don't quit French.
8392701,eng,He wanted to learn to tango.
282795,eng,The criminals have all been apprehended.
29058,eng,And I will raise it again in three days.
7414635,eng,Sami is familiar with this story.
6621992,eng,"Mr. Hungerton, her father, really was the most tactless person upon earth—a fluffy, feathery, untidy cockatoo of a man, perfectly good-natured, but absolutely centred upon his own silly self."
1224281,eng,You're worth gold.
7199597,eng,Tom promised he would tell us.
10783707,eng,He's fired.
6870961,eng,I would have advised Tom not to do that.
3152716,eng,That's why I'm giving it to you.
2679513,eng,I live on my own.
8409340,eng,She's a hair expert.
10207783,eng,Ziri was reading.
9809061,eng,Let's hope that Tom's opinion changes.
3908615,eng,"If you don't tell her, I will."
7150111,eng,Why aren't you in Australia with Tom?
10185054,eng,Replicability is at the forefront of the modern research agenda.
7276545,eng,Sami is on Instagram.
5153921,eng,Tom said he thought we shouldn't go to Mary's party.
6540909,eng,It took a moment for the words to sink in.
266959,eng,Spring comes between winter and summer.
72311,eng,Come to my house at eight.
5748282,eng,Let's see some action.
1026721,eng,Tom cancelled his party because something came up.
6495274,eng,Tom and Mary admitted they weren't actually the one who did that.
7436377,eng,Tom and Mary said that they didn't like to do that.
2111902,eng,Don't smile.
3825249,eng,I can't believe this is what Tom really wants us to do.
8855564,eng,The idea of being in a quiet place with no entertainment is extremely anxiety provoking for extroverts.
6423574,eng,Mary did that as often as she could.
5361982,eng,Let's build a bonfire!
1026940,eng,Tom burns both wood and coal in his stove.
8825700,eng,He wore gold rimmed pince-nez.
6576956,eng,Raise your flag!
3377135,eng,You completely ignored me.
6514614,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were worried.
10196915,eng,"Coffee? ""Yes, please."""
65325,eng,Edison invented a device for duplication.
7815297,eng,The train ride was three hours.
6685174,eng,Tom was fairly nervous.
7731542,eng,I thought Tom was supposed to be your best friend.
757415,eng,"When are you coming back? ""That all depends on the weather."""
315295,eng,She is traveling around the world.
1898379,eng,"For all we know, Tom could be in Boston."
7806145,eng,The butcher knife is in the drawer.
273910,eng,Grandmother sent us a box of apples.
299052,eng,He accelerated his car and overtook me.
9188584,eng,I hope nobody sits in front of us.
2674682,eng,"Her large, deep, blue eyes had a dreamy look, but a childlike smile still played round her mouth."
5592661,eng,This is the first time I've done this.
7241470,eng,Sami follows Layla on Twitter to this day.
6243110,eng,I should probably tell Tom to do that.
5735628,eng,Tom is having an awesome time.
7871165,eng,He has lived in Kabylie for four years.
6731154,eng,Mary's lost her mittens.
6416615,eng,I just want Mary to know that we'll miss her.
8828937,eng,Does Tom still dance?
10593236,eng,The government is lying.
8415844,eng,Tom probably won't remember to do that.
6894818,eng,To battle for something in life without leaving scorched earth behind you is a priceless deed.
9138298,eng,Tom decided to kill Mary.
6981853,eng,"The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs."
4971017,eng,I think prostitutes are victims and troubled girls.
60913,eng,This diamond is not real.
27178,eng,A chain of events led to the outbreak of the war.
6223584,eng,No one else at the party spoke French.
738794,eng,Is it strange for you that even I’m a man?
7895930,eng,It broke into two pieces.
7442584,eng,Tom and Mary think that they're being reasonable.
3518536,eng,It was a bad movie.
6240388,eng,I wouldn't try doing that if I were drunk.
3447093,eng,I didn't know Tom was a singer.
6342818,eng,Tom found it difficult to stay on his diet.
32639,eng,I'm not good at speaking English yet.
6713831,eng,Sami went on trial.
5746827,eng,Tom is always winging it.
7897824,eng,I'm afraid that you're sitting in the wrong seat.
6242978,eng,I told Tom I wouldn't do that for him.
291750,eng,He can speak a little English.
9323652,eng,Tom switched the wine glasses without my noticing.
10359780,eng,You should have stayed there.
9115857,eng,You're pulling my chain.
10532138,eng,The courier is late.
9105285,eng,They strive to go to the Moon.
6430172,eng,Tom won't hurt anyone again.
272228,eng,The Stone Age ruins were discovered.
6316173,eng,Hardly anyone has seen this animal up close.
6003756,eng,Tom and Mary became friends right away.
3769267,eng,You aren't any better than me.
6648038,eng,Tom said that he wished that he hadn't given his phone number to Mary.
5055375,eng,All help is in vain.
10244118,eng,Things slowly got better.
69308,eng,You were mine.
9788543,eng,Now it's clouded over.
5639925,eng,I've seen pictures of it.
8481063,eng,"Here, take this!"
7321262,eng,Sami went to have fun.
10022089,eng,Another chance will turn up.
7893955,eng,"Wherefore, going up to the steward of the house, at the door, they said: Sir, we desire thee to hear us. We came down once before to buy food: And when we had bought, and were come to the inn, we opened our sacks, and found our money in the mouths of the sacks: which we have now brought again in the same weight."
6493226,eng,Tom and Mary don't like people to know that they can't speak French well.
8400131,eng,Don't get scared.
324658,eng,Hurry in for supper.
3719534,eng,Ignorance gives rise to many forms of prejudice.
10223573,eng,Ziri is a rare gem.
6421084,eng,Mary is only trying to protect herself.
1983462,eng,She's going to make it.
8351035,eng,"This pollution, known as acid mine drainage, contaminates roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) of West Virginia waterways. It's a legacy of more than a century of coal mining in the region."
7519296,eng,I know that you'll never do that.
2724692,eng,"Hey boys, what's up?"
7165060,eng,Sami got off the chair.
7317351,eng,Sami wanted to fast.
8288488,eng,"What nationality are your professors? ""They're Syrian."""
8472113,eng,He stopped to take a close look at the car.
8589621,eng,You should pack a couple of extra changes of clothes.
8013305,eng,I'll ask Tom if he can help me look for that.
6469339,eng,Sami didn't trust Layla.
6495615,eng,Tom and Mary enjoy swimming almost as much as they enjoy skiing.
7385698,eng,He opened his locker.
274678,eng,You must be kind to others.
426623,eng,Let's wash our hands when leaving the toilet!
5958549,eng,I came here by taxi.
9027011,eng,He was reading a comic book.
9565112,eng,It didn't really help.
5745850,eng,Tom has good days and bad.
8219021,eng,I don't know what to do with him anymore.
3091631,eng,She asked me if I loved her.
3151102,eng,You never gave Tom a chance.
3417407,eng,Tom gave me some good advice.
10162234,eng,All attention was riveted on the stands.
2425682,eng,Follow him!
2014695,eng,"I want to help you, but I can't."
3045853,eng,Do you think they gave Tom a square deal?
2996314,eng,There are plenty of places around here for someone to hide.
328675,eng,"From children to the elderly, sensible exercise has a good effect on the body."
5641720,eng,I haven't been told anything.
6549378,eng,Sami was trying to lure Layla back into his life.
9337572,eng,Even a coach needs a coach.
5915679,eng,Tom may not have done that by himself.
4996045,eng,"In the two years he spent as a professor of Spanish in Paris, he trod a dangerous path with the French authorities."
10532975,eng,Ziri thanked Rima for helping him out.
2478752,eng,Because I've been doing this a lot longer than you.
315765,eng,She's good at bargaining the price down.
6090590,eng,Free them.
6222529,eng,Tom doesn't usually do that by himself.
742059,eng,Gill usually acts most efficiently.
3181721,eng,Tell me who I have to talk to.
2331869,eng,I had to take a bus from Boston.
6270063,eng,Tom told Mary that she was forgiven.
10036522,eng,The pond dries up when the weather is hot.
9866694,eng,"If you can't explain it to a six year old, you don't understand it yourself."
9800525,eng,Two experienced campers falling off a cliff... Is that part of a joke?
2406113,eng,I saw Tom and could barely recognize him.
6575950,eng,Sami did another search on Google.
300168,eng,He's used to speaking in public.
6378862,eng,Layla wanted to obliterate the memory of Sami's first wife.
10182890,eng,Do they have a garden?
6526334,eng,Tom's speech wasn't as boring as I thought it would be.
56111,eng,I guess I'm never going to get married.
6406665,eng,Mary says she isn't planning to go.
2569939,eng,"He who is present, is the vizier."
10052624,eng,Who is Yanni dating?
9534266,eng,I'm talking in French so that Tom doesn't understand me.
6440491,eng,Why are you sleepy?
6664720,eng,I'm going to fly to Australia.
7183106,eng,Tom agreed to go to Australia with Mary.
10694116,eng,China is becoming more powerful than the US.
10715885,eng,"I speak Esperanto and Interlingua, but I don't speak Ido."
262791,eng,We call the cat Madonna.
4012102,eng,We're tired of waiting.
6209183,eng,Rest in peace!
7540501,eng,Tom should've planted more onions than he did.
9972205,eng,"Classes resume as soon as the talk ends, so don't stick around."
2952661,eng,I wish Tom had been here today.
9733945,eng,Tom stood there for a long time without saying anything.
6645940,eng,Tell me about it tomorrow.
6357757,eng,It's in the drawer.
1047644,eng,I saw him coming out of the hotel.
6874226,eng,We're eating dinner outdoors.
7129753,eng,Did you know Tom would win?
3148808,eng,Plagarism in America is strictly punished.
1173249,eng,Have you heard of the rage of the Son of Heaven?
50193,eng,I have got acquainted with him since then.
4017198,eng,Please call if you find out anything.
5098029,eng,I should thank you.
6344580,eng,There's a chance that Tom will cry.
10038456,eng,Tom didn't think that Mary heard him.
3909205,eng,I can take them to the park.
3313124,eng,We couldn't have children.
5909889,eng,No one can stop me from doing that.
8527630,eng,"He's very decisive, isn't he?"
10107177,eng,Yanni spoke Arabic with a smattering of Berber.
5846293,eng,I don't want to ever leave here.
293353,eng,He chucked me the apple.
3077580,eng,So what if I'm gay?
7473595,eng,They haven't yet bought what they need.
9015624,eng,Tom is now working as a cardiologist.
2542652,eng,I told Tom and Mary about you.
7732545,eng,Tom got there before me.
268934,eng,Lack of sleep began to tell on me.
894958,eng,What is your favorite time of year?
6372965,eng,I saw your sister the day before yesterday.
6498781,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't get enough sleep last night.
7279120,eng,Sami grabbed Layla by the hair and he started swinging her around.
10450019,eng,"Close your eyes, relax and let your imagination and emotions run freely."
891658,eng,Did you buy a return ticket?
8615127,eng,It smells wonderfully of börek.
4499213,eng,What happened in 2013?
8563917,eng,Algeria needs to spend more on infrastructure.
7503927,eng,I know Tom didn't know who was going to help Mary do that.
254171,eng,I heard the news by chance.
10768855,eng,Dozens of Palestinians were injured by Israeli troops inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
1028262,eng,Tom occasionally visited Mary at her parents' house.
8119141,eng,I talked about Kabylie.
5257324,eng,The only ones who know for sure are Tom and Mary.
10479268,eng,It turns out that Tom is younger than he told me he was.
10115627,eng,I know the family that lives in that house.
9373254,eng,Thank you for your thoughtful and compassionate response.
18128,eng,By chance we saw him as he came out of the shop.
2358938,eng,I haven't always had friends like Tom.

6810136,eng,Sami turned on his headlights.
309901,eng,She is not such a girl as you imagine her to be.
7168273,eng,I think that Tom expected Mary to hug him.

1938849,eng,I thought Tom would be in Boston by now.
3392324,eng,"At first, I thought that it was a witch who had turned into a raven."

8590825,eng,I'm not going if no one else is going to go.
5851005,eng,I don't think I'm very funny.
4887847,eng,I enjoy what I do.
4012945,eng,There's no time for that.
3728682,eng,Take your best shot.
7845800,eng,The wife was cycling.
5739553,eng,Tom does it faster than you.
6685280,eng,We're probably going to have a good time doing that.
2028368,eng,I don't want Tom's death on my conscience.
7735556,eng,Tom asked Mary to draw him a map.
392284,eng,You should return what you borrow.
6341403,eng,Tom told me he's not going to do that anymore.
8610683,eng,Algeria needs clever investors.
281597,eng,Japan is rich in beautiful scenery.
7778202,eng,I understand what you mean now.
8475535,eng,He froze.
8533246,eng,It felt like hours.
6125705,eng,That's all Tom really wanted to do.
1093332,eng,Tom knows better than to throw rocks at the other children.
7348214,eng,Sami didn't want to sit here.
4012251,eng,What makes you think I wasn't trying?
10536833,eng,Just because you think it's not possible doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
6861551,eng,"Fascism is the hereditary enemy of every thought, whatever that thought may be."
1048808,eng,"In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling."
10163109,eng,Is it true that Tom knows French?
264847,eng,"The LDP brought out a bill to raise taxes, but they met with such violent opposition that they backed down."
3386913,eng,Tom felt very bad about what had happened.
3200671,eng,Do I have to tell you again?
292841,eng,He is just a kid.
6418758,eng,Mary had no idea that Tom didn't like her.
29132,eng,She has a little money put aside.
3286793,eng,I've never seen one of these before.
2497802,eng,The movie had to be cut in several places.
10108783,eng,Wolves are not as smart as foxes.

7194203,eng,I didn't know that Tom came from Australia.
2130695,eng,He is a man who loves ritual.

6490489,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John needed at least $300 to buy everything he needed.
2644622,eng,You said we were invited.
6239571,eng,"I didn't think I would be bored, but I was."
7117747,eng,I was thinking I'd get a scholarship somewhere.
9722412,eng,It is a strange story.
24863,eng,What kind of sandwich do you want?
9962276,eng,Obama is the current president of the USA.
6498141,eng,Tom and Mary said they knew we wouldn't be able to do that.
2236154,eng,Tom can't retire.
2955739,eng,Tom and Mary come from the same country.
7390968,eng,He seldom eats with his family.
5752000,eng,I know we need to win.
3913182,eng,Let her leave.
10282736,eng,There is no need to say such mean things to people who have only just joined and don't yet know the ins and outs.
2643350,eng,There's no rule against that.
6237624,eng,Are you sure that you won't do that tomorrow?
6254281,eng,Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is the one who did that.
5248629,eng,She'll say everything and change nothing.
9640875,eng,"You're not very good at French, are you?"
37938,eng,"Whichever way you go, you can get to the station."
7472578,eng,Tom and Mary did that until they died.
4922065,eng,Let's go someplace warm.
2644472,eng,Tom and Mary are a couple.
6607780,eng,Brazil is a very big country.
5324906,eng,I'm improving my knowledge of Breton.
1897728,eng,It was never our intention to deceive you.
657156,eng,An ice pack will numb the pain.
3737753,eng,Where's my apple juice?
1390550,eng,Do you know if he is available? I need to know in order to make an appointment with him.
7646795,eng,She's from Lisbon.
2254673,eng,Where's your boyfriend?
6430846,eng,I think Tom didn't want to do that by himself.
954030,eng,"It doesn't make much sense to me that it works well on my computer, but not on yours."
6051901,eng,The rich aren't held accountable for their actions.
2892330,eng,Tom is more likely to help than Mary is.
2740246,eng,Composting helps the environment.
2268574,eng,The street is decorated with banners.
36153,eng,Love your neighbors.
8529419,eng,"He's a good photographer, isn't he?"
8616874,eng,The Fed is America's central bank.
9910059,eng,Both Tom and Mary passed away.
8168018,eng,Tom got laughed out of the room.
9395572,eng,You shouldn't get married until eighteen.
65599,eng,We have only a small garden.
6898415,eng,I won't call you again.
3736729,eng,I don't even know if Tom has a girlfriend or not.
5939869,eng,Scientists had been hypothesizing the existence of black holes long before one was discovered.
2956661,eng,Tom doesn't like being poor.
8559372,eng,A giraffe's diet consists mainly of acacia leaves.
2457384,eng,You'd better bandage the wound at once.
7380769,eng,"Mary is very tough, isn't she?"
10047965,eng,Yanni felt loved.
6247486,eng,Tom got exactly what he said he wanted.
5681169,eng,We're planning to have a Christmas party on Christmas Eve.
6426711,eng,Mary isn't wearing her uniform.
7129767,eng,Check out that girl.
6273661,eng,Tom will vouch for me.
1093917,eng,Tom got sunburned.
6495767,eng,Tom and Mary would've done that by themselves if they could've.
3024342,eng,"I googled ""Boston"" to see what I could find out before I went there."
8394065,eng,I wasn't able to do anything for Tom.
55068,eng,"As these trees grow tall, they rob the grass of light."
2747668,eng,I think Tom doesn't like me very much.
7168886,eng,I think that Tom is still asleep.
17979,eng,No wonder you could not open the door.
8549686,eng,Wash your towels with odor cleanse.
2722176,eng,The employees are rude and unhelpful.
9956374,eng,It was a cold snowy day.
3635891,eng,Tom followed me home.
1230485,eng,There are so many people at this concert.
4861693,eng,My son does not follow me.
6505355,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were having a lot of fun.
8149112,eng,Muslim isn't an ethnicity.
735722,eng,Tom is two years my senior.
9022934,eng,A good appetite is a sign of health.
25925,eng,The speaker should stand where everyone can see him.
8919968,eng,Tom isn't at home at the moment.
3915694,eng,We all hate you.
6873203,eng,I'm following that car.
3738744,eng,Who else was present?
6567078,eng,Sami told Layla to go to the hospital.
6262714,eng,I should've been helping you.
7402427,eng,He has done the best he can.
10020309,eng,Yanni has his own wardrobe.
10524590,eng,I'm getting a book today.
6348062,eng,Tom really needed to go yesterday.
4753829,eng,"We have your size, but not in that color."
315684,eng,She is a college student.
2713086,eng,Tom looked through the window.
10129374,eng,Tom didn't understand why.
8475992,eng,We liked him.
2873743,eng,I unearthed one.
10367029,eng,I can't stand dirty jokes.
1330632,eng,He told him to study.
9799427,eng,Tom needs to go to the bathroom.
6899303,eng,"Tom is intelligent, isn't he?"
7194302,eng,Are you planning on staying in Australia for a long time?
3513528,eng,Does Tom want me to teach him French?
534652,eng,Somehow I just can't accept that.
282690,eng,Which is the departure platform?
6438602,eng,Tom is going to join us later.
3342477,eng,Your history teacher would be proud.
9993194,eng,Tom wants everyone to like him.
9721106,eng,"During her life, she was married to three husbands and practised three trades."
7222558,eng,I hope Tom and Mary get along.
6423924,eng,Mary said that Tom didn't like her.
8793240,eng,Skura was wrong about that.
240402,eng,We often hear it said that time flies.
8672218,eng,I wonder when the flies will show up.
4666994,eng,Tom has friends here.
2491826,eng,She picked up her books.
3070507,eng,The new government is faced with the threatening gestures of a neighboring great power.
5823077,eng,My engine is gonna go off soon.
6427657,eng,Mary said she wasn't injured.
8585394,eng,I heard somebody laughing.
2877528,eng,I really love your eldest sister.
4772845,eng,The Belgian consul invited us to tea in a restaurant close to his country's embassy.
6861047,eng,Tom smiled mischievously.
24136,eng,Let us go home.
7395935,eng,He said that he did that already.
1667891,eng,Can you take this?
9768118,eng,How much did this bottle of wine cost?
8830549,eng,Does Tom agree?
9463100,eng,"Get out of my house. ""Are you serious?"""
6249453,eng,Tom has lived here for his whole life.
67796,eng,That problem has really got me.
3824818,eng,You don't know what I experienced.
40593,eng,"In all probability, the money will not be paid."
10625455,eng,I don't speak French that often anymore.
6518347,eng,Tom and Mary are staying at their aunt's.
4530064,eng,It was an amazing trip.
2704882,eng,From bad to worse!
7240742,eng,You know I like you.
4795800,eng,"Well, don't you know Esperanto?"
6274043,eng,I looked at the sky.
7436586,eng,Tom and Mary said that they would do that for us.
2262229,eng,Let Tom have fun.
6350181,eng,Tom told me you didn't do that.
323197,eng,Wait until tomorrow morning.
8970294,eng,Do you have your bathing suit with you?
6020430,eng,"If you want to change someone's opinion on something, the worst way to do it is to scoff at them."
6407729,eng,I thought we were in love.
1095380,eng,Tom certainly looked and sounded better than he did last month when we visited him.
6708106,eng,Sami can't manage this.
3688208,eng,Ellen doesn't speak Welsh.
9995573,eng,Yanni was working.
2543821,eng,I thought you left with Tom.
6335719,eng,Let's send these books to Tom.
9733807,eng,I am the ghost of Thomas Jackson.
10046082,eng,She burst into sobs at the news.
55327,eng,Would you show me a less expensive camera than this one?
1370516,eng,Let's end this debate.
6004018,eng,I hate science.
3820399,eng,"Tom wanted to kiss Mary, but he didn't."
7385483,eng,He looked over his shoulder.
2647615,eng,"Stay with them, Tom."
8027076,eng,A lot of things happened at once.
7408788,eng,They admitted that they'd been unfair.
1239166,eng,"This job is tough, though it has other compensations."
10216668,eng,Was Ziri right?
7250083,eng,Sami took a picture.
9241176,eng,Tom reached for a dictionary that was on the very top shelf.
3405634,eng,He wrote his diary in broad Scots.
681829,eng,Mary was thinking about her question.
323891,eng,The problem was that I had nothing to say to him.
7132448,eng,It seems Tom may be disappointed.
8904103,eng,"You, the person reading this, are beautiful."
8910344,eng,He's dropped out of his law degree.
3823793,eng,Let's send them all home.
8803353,eng,Yanni's body was hanging from the bridge.
4025114,eng,Dan came across an injured raccoon.
9081308,eng,Yanni parked his camper near the mosque.
8909515,eng,We will help as much as possible.
7185614,eng,When was the first time that you came here?
6500926,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom and Mary are going to be there tonight.
9770709,eng,Yanni was a school teacher with a reputation for being strict.
10178975,eng,I used to go to this church.
6236159,eng,I was surprised that I didn't have to do that.
7202401,eng,Sami took his car to the mechanic.
8201131,eng,Abraham is mentioned in the Quran.
6504552,eng,Maybe Tom and Mary don't know what they did was wrong.
6236364,eng,I doubt very seriously that Tom will be home.
37219,eng,Tom doesn't run as fast as Bill.
6696398,eng,Sami was still sucking his thumb.
324202,eng,You must bind yourself to keep the promise.
7306888,eng,Sami and Layla are Muslims.
1528033,eng,Please insert a coin.
6414312,eng,Mary didn't get up as early as she usually does.
8095194,eng,Tom really looks like he's having fun.
8052538,eng,Mennad is going to graduate in a month.
2331838,eng,I had to make a list of things to buy.
6142491,eng,Where does the wind blow from?
1887141,eng,I can't make it.
16600,eng,You must inform your superior of the results.
3852682,eng,What crap! Your arrogant comments aren't just useless but also a pain in the arse.
8792290,eng,She regretted lying.
4847850,eng,When does his plane take off?
2544027,eng,"They won't let you in, Tom."
2952137,eng,I have no idea who Tom's wife is.
9146451,eng,"Tom isn't ready to begin, is he?"
10778432,eng,"Did you ring me today? ""No. Why?"" ""Because the telephone rang, and I didn't know who else would be ringing."" ""Wasn't me, honestly!"""
2688455,eng,They moved house in search of greater comfort and security.
10756472,eng,He wants to become more independent.
1141193,eng,Tom signed his name with the pen Mary had given him.
9036981,eng,No state has a right to exist.
8960838,eng,The lift goes up to the top floor.
3351908,eng,No one is in charge of your happiness except you.
9159323,eng,Everyone gave Tom a telling-off.
6462276,eng,Sami killed himself without leaving a note.
9853596,eng,Tom taught his children what they needed to know to survive.
3902998,eng,I know you're working with her.
7963123,eng,I'm utterly unsuited to express my feelings.
6244600,eng,Do you know what street Tom lives on?
7521824,eng,I know Tom is stranded.
8521605,eng,He poured drinks for himself and her.
6825847,eng,Mary really looks pretty today.
8528519,eng,"He's nearly finished, isn't he?"
4495851,eng,Pay attention to us.
6506244,eng,I'm much better at French than Tom and Mary are.
37163,eng,Tom slipped out of the classroom.
3727871,eng,You can work around that.
10613399,eng,I have gray eyes and dark blond hair.
1331504,eng,I have to go to my cousin's baptism.
2585425,eng,I'll solve that problem.
7386779,eng,She's still living with her parents.
4013624,eng,Let me ask you a few questions.
4770607,eng,Ukrainian girls are the prettiest in the world.
3401900,eng,I forgot to tell Tom and Mary to bring their lunch.
2956428,eng,Tom did as I told him.
2011748,eng,Do you want to risk it?
2278743,eng,I can't give this dictionary to anyone.
6861052,eng,There's something else that's been bothering me.
10223056,eng,Ziri and Rima aren't getting back.
9771383,eng,Yanni can eat as many figs as he wants.
6125901,eng,Tom and Mary were talking about their plans.
310017,eng,She flatly refused to let him in.
6511818,eng,I think Tom and Mary aren't in Boston now.
6795032,eng,I heard that Tom and Mary killed themselves.
10650463,eng,I saw three giraffes.
7375305,eng,Mary still hasn't paid all her bills.
10758547,eng,I've never thought about that.
3723561,eng,Let's save the ones we can save.
7766810,eng,He came back.
1830395,eng,Tom ate in the classroom with his classmates.
19050,eng,The teacher often emphasizes that students should have courage.
1227089,eng,The trip was very expensive.
2044503,eng,You all look so happy.
9634609,eng,She didn't know that she was a minor.
7383090,eng,He killed himself three months ago.
887576,eng,She watched him draw a picture.
3064569,eng,I feel ashamed for living on now.
8692984,eng,Tom had no experience with girls.
5757464,eng,It isn't just that.
10297113,eng,Ziri took that as a yes.
5210219,eng,I didn't know that Tom was the one who did that.
3724522,eng,It's kind of you to ask.
5357942,eng,"Tom did not hesitate to come to Mary's rescue, even at the risk of his own life."
1225396,eng,Our birthday party will be here.
10025755,eng,There's nothing wrong with staying silent when there's nothing to say.
10472778,eng,Your age doesn't matter.
10760566,eng,The Tisza flows into the Danube.
9021330,eng,Skura is the new owner of this hotel.
10653600,eng,Is there anything else that's troubling you?
6440548,eng,Tom will get hurt.
7163874,eng,I want to be back in Australia.
6376118,eng,Sami began a cyber affair.
10501731,eng,The tests show you have fewer platelets than usual.
6423088,eng,Mary says she's feeling very sleepy.
4890356,eng,Why does that interest you?
2859437,eng,She tried that.
275426,eng,The typhoon hit Tokyo.
7279531,eng,Sami never petted his pitbull.
7966908,eng,Tom is going to be talking about his trip.
10782538,eng,Tom was crouching down.
7180899,eng,I was about your age when I came to Australia.
10755229,eng,The air here is polluted.
6274003,eng,Tom can't do that now.
10061550,eng,"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America."
9959181,eng,Tom can speak French as well as Mary.
6966173,eng,The Palestinians of the West Bank are being dispossessed of their lands and homes.
2275850,eng,I didn't get his name.
8535438,eng,He's the one who told me about her.
1201396,eng,What's your favorite scene from the show?
7228542,eng,I don't think that Tom would agree with you.
5420510,eng,"He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock."
8316695,eng,Where do we live?
710944,eng,Recent advances in medicine will usher in a new age in medical care.
5509252,eng,I woke up at seven o'clock.
6343531,eng,I doubt if Tom will agree to do that.
2107675,eng,We won.
8659516,eng,The diver put on his diving gear.
63081,eng,Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away.
6558256,eng,I don't want to live that way.
9867964,eng,"If Tom doesn't help you, I will help you."
3916745,eng,Keep away from us.
10147148,eng,There was a lot of commotion.
5402772,eng,The bridge was bombed only at the end of the conflict.
2218505,eng,You're very wise.
5189246,eng,Tom is probably used to it by now.
5830846,eng,Tom squeezed Mary's shoulder.
296280,eng,He whistled for his dog.
6040802,eng,Layla was sitting at a bus stop.
9816875,eng,"Tom is in that store over there, buying a pair of shoes."
9840659,eng,I believe it was Tom who said that.
282491,eng,I wonder when the rainy season will end.
6429551,eng,Mary has hanged herself.
9189027,eng,Avoid those who avoid you.
3919154,eng,Don't buy them anything.
6232481,eng,I hope Tom will help me.
7191414,eng,I wanted Tom to go to Australia with me.
4904301,eng,The abbess asked Mary if she was completely sure that the monastic life fit her.
1830464,eng,Tom will eat as soon as he gets home.
6029326,eng,There is no way through here.
6533554,eng,We just went for a walk.
6522923,eng,Tom and Mary grabbed their coat.
9777090,eng,Will Tom be staying the night?
6343447,eng,I promised Tom that I'd wait for him.
6287004,eng,Tom wiped the lipstick off his cheek.
7406826,eng,They need to clean their rooms.
5752235,eng,I'm super proud of Tom.
2318135,eng,Death is only a horizon. And a horizon is just the edge of our field of view.
4945647,eng,Let's not discuss this now.
8479097,eng,He had a secret.
9705720,eng,Who gave these flowers to you?
9142069,eng,Tom turned up at the meeting.
8071292,eng,I wanted my own room.
8856448,eng,We're expecting visitors.
2272842,eng,Tom is a patriot.
7156994,eng,I've decided not to go to Australia.
1026057,eng,Tom doesn't know why the meeting was postponed.
5129476,eng,The women paraded around seminude.
10243537,eng,Ziri had a partner.
10721028,eng,Have fun at the concert.
37028,eng,Tom has collected a great many butterflies.
6244009,eng,You should be the first one to do that.
9292444,eng,I give you my word of honor.
9501783,eng,That'll be very interesting.
7182066,eng,Tom said that he thought something was wrong.
613111,eng,They went by subway.
7382037,eng,Mary denies she did that.
6256548,eng,Tom said he thought Mary's punishment was appropriate.
6513816,eng,Tom and Mary said they haven't yet done that.
2543249,eng,Can I pay you back on Monday?
301566,eng,He was appointed ambassador to Britain.
6260248,eng,Tom will probably tell Mary he doesn't like her.
47522,eng,He insists on going to the park with his father.
7466050,eng,Did you tell him yet?
7140063,eng,Sami will go with Layla.
765941,eng,Let me leave!
10221903,eng,Ziri decided to do that.
10225723,eng,Ziri eats his dessert.
6423753,eng,Mary wanted Tom to leave her alone.
7095659,eng,There are many Egyptian obelisks in Rome.
6651721,eng,Tom said he was looking forward to being retired.
260508,eng,I can't forgive him for behaving like that.
5902787,eng,We're both OK.
3826098,eng,Tom doesn't want to go to Boston.
10759064,eng,Now I know much more than before.
9464953,eng,Been a while since I saw you.
1962369,eng,Talk of the devil and he's sure to appear.
7440824,eng,They said they did it wrong.
10087095,eng,I didn't know you smoked.
1725519,eng,"What makes one sad about love, it is not so much to not be loved when you love, but to still be loved when you do not love anymore."
268163,eng,The firemen had the fire out in no time.
6494608,eng,I thought Tom and Mary might be permitted to do that by themselves.
10048699,eng,I added Tom's name to the list.
1387107,eng,I told you no!
7114733,eng,"Not only did it need luck, but it required much work, time, endurance and acceptance of risk."
6657264,eng,You don't seem to be as resourceful as Tom seems to be.
3419482,eng,I'll hug you to death.
6198056,eng,How would Tom look today if he were still alive? The following photomanipulation attempts to find an answer to this.
1319632,eng,It has been six years since I started to study English.
288625,eng,He returned from Holland in June.
2301942,eng,I can't believe you think I'm pushy.
7866704,eng,I want to be fluent in Berber.
56430,eng,This watch was handed down to me by my grandfather.
5936903,eng,Tom is waiting to pick his nephew up.
55174,eng,These goods may not be available locally.
3273592,eng,He found your keys. He stumbled upon them by chance.
9466172,eng,There aren't any foxes here.
8552448,eng,We saw a UFO.
8789775,eng,I was born in the thirties.
6424300,eng,Mary begged me to help her do that.
4017367,eng,I should've followed your advice.
9353621,eng,Tom's house is made of wood.
8377463,eng,Tom will be the last to leave the store.
7143590,eng,I didn't think that Tom would like Boston.
906871,eng,What's your favorite season of the year?
10678681,eng,The only advice I can give you is to talk to her with your heart on your sleeve.
5154796,eng,Everyone knows Tom was the one who broke the window.
295076,eng,"As he is a married man, he has to think of the future."
6090267,eng,I think that was the problem.
6415975,eng,Mary tried to get Tom to cook dinner for her.
6568294,eng,Sami was frantic with worry.
35388,eng,"Do you go by bus, by train, or by subway?"
1741869,eng,Don't let him sleep.
7436667,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't find it funny.
8030183,eng,"Even if I'd had enough money, I wouldn't have bought it."
7735685,eng,I'll ask Tom to take a picture of us.
7377654,eng,Mary has assured me she'll do that.
306624,eng,They were scattered in all directions.
6230994,eng,It should be possible for you to do that by yourself.
2229526,eng,"The fog was so dense, we could hardly see anything."
287589,eng,I am alarmed by your irresponsible attitude.
2374678,eng,I keep having this dream about drowning.
8412728,eng,I found the plot of this book confusing.
5791103,eng,Why do I have to sing with Tom?
6254752,eng,Tom said he wanted to give Mary another chance to do that.
3730409,eng,Isn't Tom on your side?
805056,eng,It is upon awakening that we realize it was a dream.
5821605,eng,We both work full time.
10052725,eng,Yanni found the information helpful.
3738423,eng,Why do I need a lawyer?
2764361,eng,His hesitation made me doubt.
2641204,eng,Have you ever seen Tom do that before?
7276432,eng,"He is drunk, that's why he staggers."
9980416,eng,Yanni needs to clean his windshield first.
8146912,eng,Algeria has a fascinating history.
7431295,eng,I am reading the label.
4496452,eng,Tom made three changes.
10753201,eng,Medvedev was far more liberal than Putin.
2111725,eng,I'm home.
3907217,eng,Why don't you show it to them?
6728447,eng,Isn't my friend Icelandic?
554755,eng,I think it's possible for people to live on the moon.
10581046,eng,Snow can bend the roof.
5043245,eng,Money is tight right now.
6676627,eng,I suspect Tom likes you.
5068525,eng,Don't wake me.
300695,eng,He is delicate.
7991821,eng,Sami didn't want to cause issue.
9116776,eng,Everyone was being loud and obnoxious.
10206189,eng,Sheep were grazing in the field beyond.
5726490,eng,I can't spend money I don't have.
249963,eng,I have two daughters and two sons.
3363711,eng,What's all this?
7182759,eng,Tom said that he didn't hear anybody scream.
312776,eng,She acted as if she didn't care what happened.
6260998,eng,Tom looked like he'd been crying.
5108916,eng,It is very different the way of thinking between the two religions.
2422988,eng,How do you write ‘pretty’?
5752475,eng,Tom proved them wrong.
7217942,eng,I told Tom where Mary was born.
2541872,eng,I'm in a little bit of trouble.
8904657,eng,Pass the ball to me.
7963315,eng,Sami isn't sleeping on the couch.
6873358,eng,"If you catch a cold, you can't easily get rid of it."
6065000,eng,Tom said he had something important to ask Mary.
3885013,eng,A fire broke out in the 86-story Torch tower in Dubai.
10729274,eng,The official language of the country is French.
2887759,eng,You were woken up.
6274212,eng,Tom thinks Mary is nervous.
2541274,eng,That strike lasted three months.
7681762,eng,"He speaks a little bit, all of his time is taken up by his farm work."
6869310,eng,Tom should have been more curious than he was.
7954235,eng,I need to talk to you now!
3854926,eng,"Tom celebrated his fortieth birthday the other day, without fanfare or trumpets."
5938917,eng,I've never had a beard.
3431356,eng,Tom is the one I'm waiting for.
31533,eng,You are old enough to know better. Behave yourself.
3410985,eng,Tom invited me personally.
321265,eng,"In Hokkaido, they make horses of straw."
2016984,eng,Why did you want to come back here?
258952,eng,I want to travel all over the world.
7126302,eng,How long does that take?
6510304,eng,Tom and Mary have to get up early tomorrow.
7127723,eng,How would you characterize your current relationship?
6521469,eng,I'm glad Tom and Mary are safe.
7472173,eng,Tom and Mary say that they'll go with us.
2640726,eng,Tom says that he'll never come back here.
6036310,eng,What's that tree?
715081,eng,I often went skiing in the winter.
5983864,eng,"A giant 100kg gold coin issued by the Royal Canadian Mint, dubbed the ""Big Maple Leaf"", has been stolen from the Bode Museum in Berlin."
681487,eng,A minor is dependent on his parents.
6262642,eng,I used to study French a lot.
9755005,eng,Hi. What's new?
2203646,eng,I'm dieting.
6781733,eng,I found it exciting.
10321270,eng,I want to buy the same kind of car that Tom wants to buy.
7037826,eng,The best time for grapes is September.
2549387,eng,I told the truth.
2187195,eng,It's adorable.
2255467,eng,Your room's ready.
7846040,eng,When will you go back to Boston?
6713684,eng,Sami disappeared for about six years.
10216729,eng,Ziri is so happy for Rima.
7342580,eng,I was only dancing with her.
2387525,eng,I need some medical advice.
7197455,eng,It isn't perfect.
2642467,eng,Is anybody going to pick Tom up?
3518073,eng,All rights reserved.
309379,eng,Her hands are raw from the cold.
2895943,eng,I'll keep the menu as a souvenir.
6873041,eng,I'm married and I have a daughter.
7515519,eng,Did you get the package that I sent you?
6338703,eng,I didn't think you'd be able to convince Tom to do that.
3673690,eng,We could hear the children laughing.
8567658,eng,When did you and Tom get married?
6652769,eng,Tom said he thought that he'd be able to help Mary do that.
7382119,eng,"Mary is fine, isn't she?"
8445550,eng,What problems did you have?
8560782,eng,They became separatists.
3162090,eng,"Instead of complaining, maybe Tom should just help us do it correctly."
6048783,eng,"If you don't help me, who will?"
7513495,eng,Didn't Tom know he was supposed to do that?
7396128,eng,She said she learned something new.
2083052,eng,What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
8792812,eng,Yanni was losing his temper.
7391112,eng,She started to untie her shoes.
27617,eng,The bus was empty except for one elderly woman.
2314957,eng,I didn't know what size to get.
9479502,eng,I could tell Tom was from Australia because of his accent.
8900520,eng,What's 'thank you' in Berber?
6966163,eng,They need to get rid of the people who are already there.
9801362,eng,Yanni cleaned up his vomit.
10786459,eng,Perhaps something could be going on behind our backs that I don't know about?
265766,eng,Young people like popular music.
6870569,eng,Tom never would have done that if Mary had asked him not to.
7021188,eng,Tom can't sleep with the door open.
7174390,eng,I thought that I'd go to Boston next month.
8553971,eng,We'd better camouflage ourselves.
8986769,eng,Could you call a doctor for me?
68066,eng,They are free from care and anxiety.
9777530,eng,Such a response is not warranted.
6944721,eng,"Would you like tea or coffee, sir? ""Well, that depends on whether you mean inclusive or or exclusive or."""
6888652,eng,"The Company of the gods rejoiced at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris, whose heart was firm, the triumphant, the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris."
9283178,eng,What's a Jew?
7517972,eng,I knew Tom was upstairs in his room.
6253108,eng,I wanted to go to business school.
6423769,eng,Mary told me that she was offended.
8548083,eng,Tom tried to introduce himself in French.
5839585,eng,Fadil survived the brutal assault.
6344643,eng,I'm pretty sure that Tom won't win.
7390638,eng,She put a flea collar on her dog.
2643402,eng,Do you have a recommendation?
9689881,eng,"Yanni was in the clutches of Skura, a master manipulator."
3407526,eng,The lovebirds were very happy together.
7378347,eng,"Mary is eager to leave, isn't she?"
6472109,eng,Tom seemed comfortable talking with me.
4110422,eng,A gentleman should open doors for his girlfriend.
10200518,eng,"How do you do, fellow kids?"
10075549,eng,Thank you for explaining everything to me.
6806774,eng,Sami's gift is ready.
2998255,eng,"He is, without doubt, much better than you."
3918703,eng,Did someone contact them?
9755969,eng,Tom likes guacamole.
8859135,eng,He himself made supper.
10462440,eng,There's cobwebs in my drawers.
1423277,eng,This is the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
7963171,eng,Sami needs to be careful in this neighborhood.
2647358,eng,We need to be going.
5454836,eng,Tom skipped a grade.
5852414,eng,I don't follow politics at all.
719229,eng,The Italians always eat spaghetti.
7544623,eng,Tom is making a video.
10739334,eng,This fishpond is full of fish.
2958355,eng,Tom took out his false teeth.
27227,eng,I feel quite refreshed after taking a bath.
6228533,eng,I thought there was a good chance that Tom would need our help.
3372943,eng,I hear you're getting married again.
1741853,eng,Don't let him break glasses.
1354879,eng,My impression of the United States is very good.
3930846,eng,Dan killed Linda with a hammer.
10273930,eng,I don't believe that Mary is in love.
5270160,eng,He lost the race because he was disqualified.
1925930,eng,Does anyone know the Japanese language?
8380877,eng,Tom is the one that did all the driving.
2273200,eng,Tom is heading west.
9185854,eng,"Tom didn't sell his cello, even though he desperately needed money."
3921147,eng,Tom winked at me.
10351288,eng,"You didn't say the whole truth, Tom."
3273712,eng,She is sore everywhere.
6648136,eng,Tom said that he wanted to buy some flowers for Mary.
6704084,eng,Tom had to stay home all last week because he had to take care of his mother.
5989476,eng,Sami was back in Layla's life.
7769078,eng,"The sheets are placed atop soil in a home planter or an outdoor garden. When watered, the pods dissolve and plants sprout in 10 days (for pea shoots) to 70 days (for dragon carrots)."
9518369,eng,"The linguist delights in dissecting sentences the way That One Kid In School delighted in dissecting frogs, and the results can be just as gruesome."
5916065,eng,I think you should do that.
4002431,eng,I'm sixteen years old.
6348684,eng,Tom saw you fishing last weekend.
7385995,eng,She retraced her steps.
1820766,eng,How many watches did Tom lose?
8988519,eng,Tom probably isn't going to be impressed by what you did.
1028356,eng,Tom lied to Mary.
6428522,eng,Mary said that she was mad.
6917969,eng,"Tom is large, broad shouldered, and muscular. Whenever he wears his camouflage shirt, it intimidates people."
9767141,eng,Let them!
10671019,eng,The car pulled into traffic.
312437,eng,She had only eaten a little before she left the table.
5913269,eng,"Sami may not remember me, but I remember him."
7506855,eng,I knew that Tom did that just to get some attention.
6260988,eng,Tom would stop doing that if Mary asked him to.
7517813,eng,I know Tom will allow me to do that.
7731572,eng,Tom was the first to come and the last to leave.
6407136,eng,Mary didn't have the courage to refuse to do what Tom asked her to do.
8549189,eng,He was talking about the delicious food they had eaten on their trip.
3911629,eng,I'm jealous of her.
7232406,eng,I don't think that Tom really has to do that anymore.
5726279,eng,I don't have the time or the inclination to help Tom.
2290422,eng,I didn't mean to wake you.
7164662,eng,Sami has six stepchildren.
2641564,eng,You'll be outnumbered three to one.
2235895,eng,Take Tom's weapon.
1026472,eng,Tom did it in his own way.
2288895,eng,Don't you think it went great?
2547599,eng,Tom got on his horse.
6268280,eng,I didn't check my mailbox.
8536923,eng,She'll get herself killed if she's not more careful.
5409469,eng,It's a big animal.
430217,eng,"We're quite insignificant, but awesome nevertheless."
2003749,eng,That's really what you want?
2740134,eng,I'm too stupid for this world.
8340618,eng,Tom didn't tell Mary what he wanted her to do.
8028474,eng,140 dollars for a Kabyle dress seems rather a lot.
8814773,eng,Where are my tampons?
5168373,eng,I wish I could find out who that was.
5858983,eng,Tom can see us.
8246634,eng,This is a predominantly Indo-Pakistani mosque.
6439599,eng,Tom wasn't really nervous.
39553,eng,Learn as many idioms as possible by heart.
6236126,eng,I wouldn't have done that if I didn't have to.
2546551,eng,I'm not letting you go.
307893,eng,"The more I know him, the more I like him."
6335904,eng,I'm better at riding a unicycle than Tom is.
2544344,eng,I woke up and Tom was gone.
10504772,eng,Can I pour you some compote?
7267786,eng,Sami needs to know a little bit more about Layla and her background.
1213437,eng,God died. We killed Him.
7888216,eng,"And we answered him: We are peaceable men, and we mean no plot. We are twelve brethren born of one father: one is not living, the youngest is with our father in the land of Canaan."
7196953,eng,I can't believe that you did that.
315989,eng,She may have known the answer.
8839171,eng,"I bought this souvenir at a museum shop at the arts center on 1 Heydar Aliyev Avenue in Baku, Azerbaijan."
9496056,eng,It didn't need to end that way.
9774087,eng,Yanni's diary will allow Skura to sue him.
6236227,eng,Tom said he knew he might be allowed to do that.
4130000,eng,Please come!
68254,eng,The young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen.
266967,eng,Haruki doesn't have much money with him.
10222055,eng,Ziri ate that cake.
8405971,eng,"I can walk back, so you don't need to give me a ride."
3100674,eng,"For the field is small, but the work is great."
7034947,eng,I'm an Arabic teacher.
9408302,eng,"What do you want, boy?"
2235400,eng,"Girls can be astronauts, too."
2545463,eng,I'll need some more time.
1951629,eng,They can't fire you.
6229429,eng,Tom turned off the living room light and went upstairs to his bedroom.
20923,eng,Would you give me some travel brochures from your country?
7174935,eng,Tom thought that he'd be safe here.
5739684,eng,Tom could make a difference.
1107952,eng,I can't shake him.
6415915,eng,Mary would do anything to get what she wants.
6676782,eng,Sami took Layla's cellphone.
2721908,eng,This new machine is much better than that old thing we had.
5937450,eng,I'm used to staying up all night.
7741125,eng,"The ship creaked and groaned, the mighty timbers bulged and bent under the heavy blows, the water broke over the decks, snapping the mainmast like a reed."
2582541,eng,"When the sun comes up, I'll get out of bed."
6043082,eng,Layla claimed she was innocent.
1437189,eng,"If by some chance the weather is good, I'll go."
7901147,eng,The wife only knows how to cook rice.
1754382,eng,I still want to be here.
2081673,eng,That wasn't the question I asked. I wanted to know something else.
2293248,eng,I assume you'll not come to work tomorrow.
2538559,eng,I wonder when the movie's going to start.
6435848,eng,Tom was waiting for Mary to call him.
30163,eng,There was a fire in this city last night.
3904293,eng,I watched you.
3063594,eng,Lovely flowers are growing everywhere.
7747259,eng,We all speak Berber.
6338430,eng,I'd rather let Tom have his own way than to argue about it.
2167830,eng,Things happen.
7205106,eng,Sami didn't care who was listening or watching.
8180442,eng,Do you think that Tom might be able to do that?
8390874,eng,He takes steroids.
5195233,eng,Can you remember when you first met Tom?
6810596,eng,Sami bought Layla a Celine Dion t-shirt.
2377470,eng,I like that skirt.
5961659,eng,I hate cake.
6254865,eng,Is there any salad dressing left?
6490674,eng,Tom and Mary said that they weren't planning to do that.
8405506,eng,We don't care about you.
266587,eng,The very sick baby was under careful observation by the doctors.
984621,eng,I suppose you like it.
8175178,eng,I'm not the one that told Tom to leave.
6125786,eng,Tom has been stopping by every day.
10320689,eng,It's a storm in a teacup.
10496784,eng,"Don't worry, I'll do it myself."
10674387,eng,That's the most interesting novel I've ever read.
7394862,eng,She left home when she was eighteen.
7377657,eng,Mary has a scratch on her forehead.
6649766,eng,Tom said that he hopes Mary likes to do that.
7537391,eng,It's no secret that Tom's opinion is different from yours.
7633230,eng,I was in Australia at the time.
6726754,eng,My upper left back tooth hurts.
1439862,eng,My mother is cooking breakfast.
6823938,eng,Let's do that Monday afternoon.
306906,eng,They started a new business.
6738329,eng,Do you enjoy watching sports?
10698114,eng,You are in love with my mother. She does not look like one of your women.
6414167,eng,Mary probably should do that as soon as she can.
5421248,eng,"The old man you saw today in the studio was Baron Hausberg. He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and that sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar."
2665004,eng,Please make a donation.
9814672,eng,Tom bought three watermelons.
7000265,eng,The cyclist climbed the hill.
9564971,eng,My right arm is strong.
6268495,eng,Tom always seems to be right.
6258360,eng,Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that.
6347427,eng,Please get Tom to do that for you.
8324600,eng,Is it a holiday you're going on to New Zealand?
6418284,eng,Mary was very skinny when she was a child.
5354734,eng,"As new competitors and predators arrive, even the most abundant Arctic species in the northern Barents Sea, the local Polar cod, could become extinct."
2018825,eng,I want you to meet a friend of mine.
6519906,eng,Do Tom and Mary know how to dance?
52600,eng,John was absent from school yesterday.
8519731,eng,He wants to explain everything to her.
1572,eng,Damn! It's not bad!
3500847,eng,"We had our priorities, they had their preferences, and we came to an impasse."
7937032,eng,You will have to excuse me but I will have to be very picky.
954084,eng,"It's kind of difficult to see in the dark, isn't it?"
7970148,eng,Sami doesn't even know that guy.
7270811,eng,Sami needed to get his wisdom teeth removed.
9268998,eng,"Suddenly, both started to run."
70244,eng,You had better consult with your teacher.
4900670,eng,Tom is the cutest boy in our class.
6500904,eng,Maybe that's the reason why Tom and Mary aren't here today.
9499120,eng,The lesson is classy.
9133156,eng,I'm not one for public confrontation.
8050313,eng,Mennad wasn't compassionate.
4666019,eng,No one has called me today.
7165694,eng,Sami was ready to kill Layla.
10531045,eng,I doubt whether Tom will come in time.
8417567,eng,"He hit me. ""Turn the other cheek."""
9176318,eng,I read that book while I was in the hospital.
8346373,eng,Arthur Brand is an art detective.
7179588,eng,Tom said that he's trying to hide Mary.
7708903,eng,Did Tom study French yesterday?
9044361,eng,Tom wasn't standing behind Mary.
9000322,eng,It's obvious that's what you want.
8340330,eng,I don't really have time to do that.
289545,eng,He is burning with anger.
6575655,eng,Sami's body was in an advanced state of decomposition.
8990644,eng,That's peanuts.
8782900,eng,They criticise him constantly.
3282148,eng,Mary is John's sister.
6337961,eng,"Because of the storm, I might not be able to get home tonight."
8416486,eng,Tom ordered one.
7231940,eng,I don't think that I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today.
2258128,eng,"Besides fruit, we're going to have ice cream."
3945076,eng,My favourite colour is blue.
6340203,eng,"If you don't want to do that, I'll ask Tom."
1844172,eng,Allow us to do our job.
2589034,eng,I don't expect you to remember.
27516,eng,Can you speak English at all?
9814000,eng,He has to stay home until eight in the evening.
4497869,eng,I can do nothing to help.
8294955,eng,I'm not myself a programmer.
5731952,eng,They couldn't find that plane.
2011573,eng,I want you back here.
7361187,eng,Sami killed innocent people.
7510091,eng,I know Tom knows who can do that and who can't.
7380785,eng,Mary is richer than she seems.
28943,eng,I could not convince him of his mistake.
9234229,eng,Yanni was drunk as a skunk.
3380682,eng,What are their rights?
6357145,eng,Tom brought it for me.
7494447,eng,Where did he find this evidence?
6657979,eng,"That isn't Tom's, is it?"
6148322,eng,Hire some engineers.
26065,eng,"On his arrival at the station, he called a taxi."
4927674,eng,Tom is a terrible dancer.
5915764,eng,Tom's whole family is very religious.
2237706,eng,Tom seems nervous.
7516558,eng,I know that Tom is a financial wizard.
2326020,eng,I feel terrible about the way things happened.
8555027,eng,He told me that he couldn't blame me for breaking my promise.
22865,eng,We studied the government's economic policy.
6268322,eng,I can't go anywhere today.
9670135,eng,The criminal tracked Tom down and killed him.
9870236,eng,Tom won't be able to handle the truth.
9359802,eng,Didn't Tom tell you what he wanted to do?
680039,eng,We're able dancers.
3738031,eng,Can I count on you tomorrow morning?
8476214,eng,They want him.
6693828,eng,Sami had to spend some time in jail.
9858562,eng,Mary will ruin her clothes.
3198904,eng,"We could all have lunch, if you'd like."
7475716,eng,They forgot to sign their names.
6512879,eng,I want to be sure Tom and Mary are happy.
3264695,eng,Tom just got a new job.
3024227,eng,I was in Boston when that happened.
248775,eng,We met at a certain place in the city.
259200,eng,I read the most interesting book in my library.
7520279,eng,I know Tom is a buddy of yours.
6422995,eng,Mary told me that she was forgetful.
6123381,eng,Tom was lying to Mary when he told her that.
8415984,eng,"Alana, stop trying to subvert the company goals."
58333,eng,Destroy this temple.
8546943,eng,The lions attacked a colossal adult giraffe.
6517371,eng,Do Tom and Mary still want to see me?
4529716,eng,Would you accept those terms?
8535917,eng,She doesn't like talking about herself.
6522124,eng,Tom and Mary looked for their pens.
2387734,eng,I need to speak to Tom now.
4499750,eng,Tom really impressed me.
9968367,eng,They've messed it up.
8416506,eng,Tom is abnormal.
4015262,eng,It's really not that hot.
2140408,eng,Finland supports Greece with a heavy heart.
10350648,eng,Are your parents going to pick you up?
4016301,eng,There's still work to be done.
10651681,eng,Tom is a very competitive player.
635910,eng,The torch does not light its own stand.
2750900,eng,It's been a long time since I've seen my family.
9687810,eng,I will be at home tomorrow in the evening.
1566989,eng,"Fear me, if you dare!"
5852324,eng,I didn't think I was that good.
9129541,eng,I'd like Tom to stay with us.
7766519,eng,There's a special place in hell for those who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.
8529146,eng,"She's very good at French, isn't she?"
254384,eng,I don't have the power to finish the work alone.
2837801,eng,Is living the goal of life?
3920229,eng,You could ask them.
7974008,eng,I had the same idea.
9164685,eng,Tom helped us do this.
7772502,eng,The eyes are the heart's windows.
436433,eng,I am sure.
10646459,eng,I came out as gay when I was 18 years old.
3626678,eng,"Unfortunately, I can't come tonight."
8247670,eng,He's ready to accept Islam.
5388200,eng,Halloumi is a salty cheese that can be fried or grilled.
6251470,eng,Tom is often the first one to arrive.
3153777,eng,Let's give Tom some room.
7442199,eng,They were very sure that they had to do that.
6958840,eng,I have myself amazing Israeli friends who don't support the apartheid system of the Israeli regime.
8955581,eng,Tom took the cable car.
5425025,eng,He won gold in the competition.
2641649,eng,Tom helped Mary out of the rowboat.
8787191,eng,He lost all his hair.
6522573,eng,"Tom and Mary are fat, aren't they?"
1955007,eng,I can't tell you how creepy this makes me feel.
3329245,eng,Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization.
6431235,eng,Tom said he thought I might not need to do that until October.
3722674,eng,Stop protecting me.
2706752,eng,Is it direct?
3156077,eng,All that I want is you!
8160857,eng,I have to check it.
9700988,eng,My husband is more handsome than Al Pacino.
6273119,eng,Tom also has to do that.
10237004,eng,Ziri asked Yazid if he could borrow his backsaw.
3619621,eng,I've found out a few things.
6662678,eng,Tom became very hot.
6728588,eng,I didn't realize Tom and Mary both had to do that.
3727351,eng,Tom heard the drums.
17153,eng,Your conduct is perfectly legal.
10782853,eng,Why don't we all go there togehter?

10180559,eng,Tom wants to be an Air Force pilot.
5852704,eng,Do you really think you're better than me?
66484,eng,There is a cat on the chair.
72031,eng,I have to cover his loss.
1228143,eng,Don't let your house smell like tuna.
55454,eng,Could this be his writing?
2515300,eng,He refused to go on holiday with his parents.
2912379,eng,How much trouble am I in?
3104478,eng,"Why are you doing that, Tom?"
7405363,eng,She says she won't mind.
10464829,eng,People spend less time in prison than you do on Tatoeba.
6267245,eng,Tom won't likely be done yet.
7394013,eng,He told everyone that he was safe.
9203644,eng,"I have to get up early tomorrow morning, so I plan to go to bed early tonight."
4963957,eng,I'm scared for my kids.
59646,eng,What's all this fuss about?
6125237,eng,Tom was scared to go in the cave.
10023384,eng,"My birthday is on April 4th. ""Mine too. What an interesting coincidence!"""
273522,eng,Traveling by sea is a lot of fun.
7389122,eng,He's preoccupied with his studies.
6237189,eng,I want to know how I can lose weight quickly.
3910619,eng,I saw him earlier this morning.
7735575,eng,I could be finished doing that by 2:30.
10496043,eng,I'm much obliged to you for your kindness.
6355029,eng,Tom must've been worried.
9937080,eng,They have never met before.
696933,eng,A caravan of fifty camels slowly made its way through the desert.
9026505,eng,Skura is a football player.
4311038,eng,They have reached a deadlock.
773300,eng,Please tell me what kind of cooking this is.
6830172,eng,Sami is attending a wedding.
8856965,eng,Laura asks everyone the same thing.
10472622,eng,The tension between Tom and Mary was palpable.
8255583,eng,They both grew up in Algiers.
5725534,eng,Several new activities are scheduled.
17120,eng,I am only too glad to help you with your work.
6242824,eng,"Which do you like better, coffee or tea?"
248534,eng,We have not seen each other since our school days.
7873162,eng,And she answered: What wilt thou give me to enjoy my company?
7006388,eng,I regret that I didn't tell Tom the truth.
6040245,eng,Do you want to leave Boston?
7125913,eng,I'm looking for my cell phone.
4803243,eng,I wonder why Tom wants to buy that car.
9026580,eng,She was still in college at that time.
266911,eng,It was springtime... and everything was quiet and peaceful in the country.
9048724,eng,Tom was the first man Mary kissed.
7537475,eng,I think that Tom has been expecting this to happen.
42650,eng,It is not far away from the hotel.
5362965,eng,"Doctor, tell me plainly, even if it’s hard: will I survive this, or have I baked my last cake? - ""For sure you’ll get well again; the only question is when."""
9045321,eng,"Tomorrow, I am going there again."
6786083,eng,Do we have to wait?
682511,eng,"In the United States, school buses are yellow."
9756370,eng,"You knocked on the door many times, but they didn't want to open it to you."
8623770,eng,When will people return to their normal way of life?
7405904,eng,She says she's busy.
6739941,eng,Tom needs to be told never to do that.
6222967,eng,Both Tom and I were happy in Boston.
7177987,eng,Tom said that Mary thought that he might not have to do that today.
5790420,eng,She has diabetes and so they chopped off her feet.
4499069,eng,Both Tom and Mary graduated last year.
7865000,eng,He's speaking to himself in Berber.
8012179,eng,Tom asked if Mary was here.
6252891,eng,Tom should've chosen something else.
879884,eng,"I shall go to the market this afternoon. How about you? ""No, I will not go."""
10107030,eng,Everyone but Tom did that.
7137058,eng,That's the reason we're doing what we're doing.
4663837,eng,Tom is expected to be here until 2:30.
6982118,eng,Ana was a beautiful girl.
569423,eng,She's wearing a hat.
9346072,eng,Didn't Tom ask you to give me something?
8143464,eng,"So, what are you waiting for?"
9452893,eng,We've made a big mistake.
9001253,eng,"I don't like tea, so I usually drink coffee for breakfast."
1545898,eng,"The slogan for the day against extremism was, ""multicolored instead of brown""."
5739665,eng,The bottom line is safety.
6327772,eng,The time has come to determine our fate and we should not wait for other people to determine it for us.
6415863,eng,Does Mary want me to drive her to the airport?
6268605,eng,Tom says Mary didn't seem to be angry.
8479281,eng,He likes trains.
840056,eng,"No matter what he does, he does it well."
1476746,eng,They like to sing.
7505029,eng,Tom and I know that Mary wants to go to Boston with us.
10632382,eng,"I think that whatever you do, if you don't find it enjoyable, it won't last a long time."
7461458,eng,I live with my husband and our Australian cattle dog Sam on the east coast of Australia.
3392967,eng,Get on over here.
8532409,eng,He told her not to waste her time.
2234091,eng,What's so hard?
8050340,eng,Mennad really appreciates that.
6245606,eng,Could it have been Tom who did that?
703859,eng,There were fifty passengers in the bus.
7543606,eng,Tom returned shortly after 2:30.
356213,eng,"All men are mortal, all Greeks are men, therefore all Greeks are mortal."
8599748,eng,Tom is busy learning French.
10031244,eng,Yanni gets this question frequently.
1415590,eng,Who told you I was talking about you?
6440598,eng,Tom is trembling.
3911845,eng,I just need her for a minute.
6027751,eng,"I have antennae for other people, and perceive how they feel."
6869510,eng,Tom should have been gone by the time we got there.
7511076,eng,I don't think your that parents would approve.
5194218,eng,I want our team to win.
6405349,eng,"The girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money bags, married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards."
837191,eng,I’m so glad to visit VNU.
69459,eng,You missed two assignments; you will have to make them up at once.
9027142,eng,I am a born artist.
6453066,eng,Sami sent Farid a homophobic message.
6331131,eng,This grizzly bear is twenty five years old.
6963958,eng,Israeli historian Ilan Pappe wrote many scholarly works.
2541775,eng,I'm sure we could arrange that.
2954882,eng,You'll have plenty of opportunity to explain yourself.
3721815,eng,I'm not ashamed of what we did.
6949820,eng,Why don't we just forget the whole thing?
6245451,eng,Tom said he didn't recommend doing that.
8133570,eng,There he will give his opinion and the summary of the novel and the debate that follows.
9723266,eng,Is Galileo your real name?
8045817,eng,Mennad is our housekeeper.
8478721,eng,He's very slim.
8064502,eng,We're in for some rain.
3442258,eng,Tom is going to prison for life.
8317052,eng,He left his gloves at the office.
7826643,eng,Every time I go to school I'm really happy.
9703702,eng,Why's everybody leaving?
6227415,eng,"Do you still do that? ""Yes, I do."" ""How about Tom?"" ""No, Tom doesn't do that anymore."""
6870952,eng,There's no way Tom would have done that.
10232081,eng,Ziri isn't here to entertain us.
5213714,eng,Do not forget the accusative!
299793,eng,He found a job with a food company.
2971812,eng,Each person forges his or her own fortune.
7367634,eng,I'm afraid there's a little snag.
1096170,eng,It hasn't been easy for Tom to earn enough money to support his large family.
300683,eng,He was slain in battle.
6268574,eng,You're a really nice kid.
7272325,eng,Sami's apartment really looks like a nightclub.
2619575,eng,"If I were you, I wouldn't do such a rude thing."
7116916,eng,Tom confessed to Mary.
8269487,eng,Go and practice Berber.
7501016,eng,Tom said that he wondered if Mary and I would be able to do that by ourselves.
9032179,eng,Tom says that he won't give up.
6912820,eng,"If I could go anywhere in the world, I'd go to Boston."
255467,eng,"I went to Victoria Station, where I saw an old friend of mine."
8572153,eng,Visit our website to find out more.
8850290,eng,"“The constant deluge of information can very rapidly shift you from the realm of ‘informed, proactive citizen’ to ‘on-fire garbage can crammed with so much content it ceases to do anything other than feed your anxiety,’” she says."
2644319,eng,Tom slipped into the room.
9165462,eng,You should go and see Tom.
6731065,eng,"Mary, where are my boots?"
6527186,eng,"Tom's parents don't go to church, but he does."
6493119,eng,I told Tom and Mary that I wasn't interested in going to Boston with them.
8567249,eng,This towel is 100% Egyptian cotton.
10755912,eng,The property is vacant.
1265164,eng,Actors and politicians never pass up a photo op.
6662664,eng,I seldom leave the house nowadays.
8071865,eng,We need to make up for the lost time.
6406806,eng,Mary's parents allow her to do a lot of things that my parents don't allow me to do.
3823801,eng,Tom will want to know what time you're planning on coming home.
7539518,eng,"I saw Tom lying next to the ladder, covered in blood."
6337541,eng,I know it wasn't difficult for Tom to win.
8536797,eng,He said that he wanted to kill himself.
4015581,eng,Tom didn't believe what he heard.
945230,eng,"They're crazy, these Romans!"
249952,eng,I have three brothers.
10709799,eng,Stay with us for a while.
3115817,eng,What you're doing right now is impolite.
6238658,eng,Tom should probably not have done that again.
9948720,eng,Basketball is fun.
319567,eng,The room was so full of smoke that I could hardly breathe.
9699495,eng,Yanni's divorce lasted longer than his marriage.
6273795,eng,Tom reminded Mary to do that.
8865878,eng,Tonight let's have a girls night.
8796623,eng,They needed surgery.
6692531,eng,It is relatively easy to tell when you have reached the thermocline in a body of water because there is a sudden change in temperature.
5758413,eng,Tom talks big.
9019943,eng,The motherland is worth more than the Kingdom of Heaven.
9525636,eng,My French isn't so good.
6247983,eng,I know Tom won't help me do that.
3904327,eng,I'll watch her.
7445336,eng,Tom was quiet all day.
3134465,eng,It could be objective.
9201040,eng,Geese are birds.
9947469,eng,Why don't we buy Tom a pony?
5758264,eng,You heard right.
1238823,eng,He attaches importance to this matter.
293948,eng,"He can't read English, much less German."
10213561,eng,Ziri is too nosy.
9995258,eng,Yanni is a tall person.
290285,eng,He is completely absorbed in his business.
8787665,eng,Yanni and Skura tried to help the old lady.
3226598,eng,I doubt we were ever in any real danger.
9937697,eng,You're a very rich person.
9951251,eng,Tom admitted that he broke the glass.
2053814,eng,Time was running out.
3908237,eng,Make sure you tell her that.
6712818,eng,Lighten up a bit.
4198303,eng,I have to write a ten-page paper by next Monday.
10669751,eng,The blue macaw is on its way to extinction.
5079140,eng,Tom has no criminal record.
8379999,eng,Why don't you tell us about yourself?
5909723,eng,You seem to be keeping yourself busy.
283638,eng,It is doubtful whether he will pass.
64382,eng,Let's have sake.
16638,eng,You'd better have your hair cut at once.
10179859,eng,Yanni was connected to the crime.
10555310,eng,Could I ask a favour of you?
6728769,eng,We definitely don't need to do that.
2311399,eng,She went to sleep and never woke up.
8519175,eng,He doesn't have to do that for her.
6666937,eng,How good a swimmer is Tom?
7594639,eng,Where are you going to perform your tarawih prayers tonight?
9359484,eng,Is Tom a reliable person?
10749375,eng,"He creates ""Little dark age"" memes."
3329822,eng,Can't we just flip a coin?
6356162,eng,Tom didn't seem to like Mary very much.
5786037,eng,Your kindness against another person is unforgettable.
2549476,eng,Tom became calm.
940492,eng,"Here, your sentence is now consigned to posterity!"
1686177,eng,If you want to get a hold on your spending you should start by cutting up all your credit cards.
7522206,eng,I can't give you money that I don't have.
8678580,eng,She doesn't remember if she turned off the light.
2235702,eng,Help Tom study.
8982037,eng,"He sat there, surrounded by his children."
6261170,eng,Tom thinks Mary is difficult to get along with.
4016850,eng,It's made of brass.
8866778,eng,My dream is to study Bisaya in Cebu.
6717769,eng,Sami claimed to be a geologist.
7494246,eng,Where did she look?
8197161,eng,Algeria built many hydropower projects.
9272021,eng,Everything was fairly normal.
10157138,eng,"He was so shy that he walked far away from his shadow, because he was embarrassed to say hi to it."
5547990,eng,Tom will tell us the truth.
837434,eng,Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.
6439623,eng,Tom said that he was free.
7870746,eng,She looked so good in her Kabyle dress.
8558550,eng,Tom believes that he will achieve the aim.
3735033,eng,Tom thought that Mary wouldn't like Boston.
3620497,eng,Please push up the lever.
7734179,eng,Where did you find the inspiration for all this?
9440342,eng,It seems somehow odd to me.
8789287,eng,I came by earlier.
1907588,eng,He did it for his family.
5029432,eng,Is Tom still on vacation?
6440451,eng,Tom won't marry you.
6344962,eng,I don't think Tom will do anything.
5652572,eng,Tom doesn't know who Mary has decided to give her old guitar to.
7383443,eng,He decided not to go by himself.
7179181,eng,Tom said that it's been fun doing that.
6325488,eng,Sami knows Layla's past.
5636634,eng,That sounds like a job for Tom.
5726637,eng,We're paying way too much money.
7199110,eng,Sami went to a gift shop.
301545,eng,He matched his gait to his companion's.
7409176,eng,They asked me to give them money.
6504053,eng,Tom and Mary said that they wanted to forget about it.
1353006,eng,The weather is terrible today.
855717,eng,The plane will take off at five.
6531739,eng,Tom is the one in charge.
8276875,eng,I hope that you don't get homesick.
6118575,eng,Do you think it'll be difficult for me to do that?
10225325,eng,Ziri is scared of us.
10515901,eng,He made up his mind to go.
2795196,eng,Bolt is bound to win.
10138601,eng,Can you eat insects?
6490112,eng,Tom and Mary say they're not interested.
2643734,eng,I thought you might be busy.
8522436,eng,He knew why the cat scratched her.
5396236,eng,Tom grew a moustache.
9471898,eng,Pack your stuff and leave.
3738946,eng,Who's the little guy?
3871316,eng,Do you want to go abroad?
6234192,eng,Tom was the first person to ever ask me to do that.
1820631,eng,How many seats are there in this room?
5732859,eng,Tom didn't complete his degree.
10527268,eng,I have to do this every day.
298869,eng,He fitted his schedule to mine.
7919305,eng,The bus isn't new but old.
9737037,eng,They're going to see the president.
8958457,eng,Colloidal silver consists of very small silver particles suspended in a liquid.
3907111,eng,You shouldn't listen to me.
3303787,eng,Is he still single?
6426628,eng,Mary said she couldn't help me.
6248887,eng,I want to know how Tom did that.
44397,eng,The program is on the air.
310203,eng,She will come back from school by six o'clock.
10029405,eng,Let's hope that that happens on Monday.
878229,eng,"Artificial neural networks can be used to understand biological neural networks, or to solve problems of artificial intelligence, without necessarily creating models of real biological systems."
7866156,eng,The Algeria-Morocco border is closed.
7211871,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was responsible for the accident.
6428538,eng,Mary said she wasn't upset.
10737849,eng,I admire your sense of duty.
4663258,eng,Would you like me to cook something for you?
8526521,eng,"He's a crook, isn't he?"
10765272,eng,I'm still not certain whether I'll be able to be there.
5241156,eng,Tom needs to stay where he is.
4934531,eng,The deep snow covered everything.
5362025,eng,Tom added wood to the fire.
10040729,eng,That isn't a very funny story.
6660753,eng,I admit that I'm the one who did that.
6234662,eng,I thought Tom would have time to do that today.
5938938,eng,Tom has to speak French.
7444600,eng,They told me they'd be supportive.
7135165,eng,Sami took a day off.
9823795,eng,Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
3232902,eng,When did Tom leave for Boston?
60207,eng,I took such a hammering over recent months.
6577796,eng,Sami got the last laugh.
6138435,eng,Sami was on the campus.
9284486,eng,It's important to eat salad.
6340890,eng,Tom isn't the one who actually wrote the letter.
2957338,eng,Tom is tougher than he looks.
8911954,eng,I tried to correct my mistakes.
6226568,eng,Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be shy.
9312391,eng,She put the steak in the freezer.
1023856,eng,Tom's diet is deficient in protein.
4266722,eng,Tom seemed bored.
387890,eng,I just got done with my French exam. It was a piece of cake!
2266307,eng,He had steak and fried potatoes.
10222482,eng,Ziri can't drive without a license.
6038092,eng,Love is a scam.
5441920,eng,The annual migration of North America's monarch butterfly is a unique and amazing phenomenon.
72382,eng,I received your letter of July 10.
8264586,eng,Tom never seemed to be interested in learning French.
319933,eng,Commodity prices were rising.
9986734,eng,We're moving away from here.
9493974,eng,His bus was late.
274767,eng,I would rather be poor than be rich by taking advantage of others.
8211569,eng,I dreamed about Tatoeba.
2251035,eng,That's a bummer.
6927913,eng,About how many times a day do you wash your hands?
9011976,eng,I see that Mary is too trusting.
1871551,eng,It's on the table.
323171,eng,Did you get everything ready for tomorrow?
10626744,eng,"Her cheeks and the tip of her nose were bright red, her eyelashes covered in a veil of ice."
7400671,eng,He told me he can see ghosts.
10083529,eng,I'd like to become an astronaut.
1627436,eng,He inserted the key in the lock.
10225163,eng,Ziri must be proud.
6415514,eng,Mary said she didn't have to work next Monday.
7405823,eng,He said he felt bad.
1397721,eng,Tom works as a bouncer in a nightclub.
3483060,eng,Tom asked me where I got this.
9735801,eng,Don't pretend to be braver than you are.
8976990,eng,"You'll take off in a minute, the way you drive so fast."
8279770,eng,But what is it?
10216627,eng,The winner was given a trophy.
3274396,eng,You can't make something from nothing.
1037202,eng,It's possible that he came here when he was a boy.
6350382,eng,Tom seemed surprised to see us.
8522476,eng,She got on a horse and followed him.
6337306,eng,I wonder if I could really do that.
7443436,eng,Tom and Mary told us that they loved skiing.
7329222,eng,Sami didn't see anything special about Layla.
50734,eng,Neither of the two answers are right.
6534847,eng,When do you get up on Sundays? When do you got to sleep?
6135549,eng,We couldn't buy the concert tickets until we got the money from our friends.
1090271,eng,He's so thin that he looks like a skeleton.
3371945,eng,Did you do that just to make her jealous?
3826425,eng,My wife just had a baby.
9809483,eng,Tom's garden is larger than Mary's.
397357,eng,There's someone at the doorway.

7735126,eng,I didn't want Tom to go out after dark.
6519132,eng,Do Tom and Mary still want to come?
5277578,eng,Tom and I have worked so hard.
6973420,eng,Tom stood in front of the class and recited the poem.
2565750,eng,Your room is very big.
18589,eng,Was the money actually paid?
3955510,eng,"During the Martian winter, ice caps can be seen at the poles."
246388,eng,I am in a spot.
3823624,eng,I've already considered that idea.
2546454,eng,This food is delicious.
8946619,eng,He's going to go to the seaside.
1454079,eng,To learn a foreign language requires a lot of time.
2241457,eng,We study together.
2237255,eng,Tom looks horrible.
6094674,eng,You look like you manage a construction site.
2642313,eng,Tom saw that Mary wasn't in bed.
6499084,eng,Tom and Mary don't want to talk to you about what happened in Boston last week.
10107475,eng,Algeria has a smaller population compared to Egypt.
2015277,eng,We all want Tom to be successful.
6266656,eng,Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary needs.
2261931,eng,I can take Tom.
1064959,eng,Does this sentence sound like something a native speaker would say?
8382830,eng,I allow my children to do what they want.
8353726,eng,I don't know when Tom is planning to get here.
9725626,eng,Yanni was very controlling.
6529673,eng,Tom isn't going to sell his house.
953815,eng,I'm already late.
5603274,eng,The capital of Spain is Madrid and the official language is Spanish.
5893926,eng,He wanted to participate in the competition.
8693633,eng,Can't you see she doesn't remember?
2700163,eng,"Bangkok, Thailand is one of the hottest cities in world. The temperature reaches 32°C or higher on almost every day of the year."
7402603,eng,She told me she's interested.
6421360,eng,Mary wouldn't let Tom sit next to her.
293547,eng,He became a great musician.
4039357,eng,I literally ate a dozen eggs on Easter Sunday.
299699,eng,He was reading a newspaper in his shirt sleeves.
8953043,eng,The laws are made to be disobeyed.
3184991,eng,Just stay out of my way.
7402624,eng,He told me he wasn't tired.
4495035,eng,It was very unreal.
8803300,eng,Yanni climbed the fence to escape.
6003990,eng,My house is near a bike trail.
3460335,eng,She's a real character.
6498328,eng,Tom and Mary could think of no reason why they should stay.
7523821,eng,Tom didn't just change jobs.
2033780,eng,"If you want to see Tom, you have to hurry."
7160891,eng,Sami heard Layla banging on the door.
2641509,eng,Tom and Mary got married last month.
9203917,eng,Tom may be doing the same thing right now.
10326149,eng,My school is three kilometers from my home.
10472714,eng,I stayed in Boston for a month.
6407468,eng,"I don't know when Mary got married, but I do know she got married."
3865013,eng,She agrees with him.
5226249,eng,I wish you a good morning!
5481090,eng,These snails are edible.
6348524,eng,No one else knows how to do that.
1164197,eng,Tom should get some sleep.
1044812,eng,A good man in an evil society seems the greatest villain of all.
6528361,eng,I visited Tom in the hospital last week.
5086273,eng,I talked with friends.
5642757,eng,Tom didn't want anyone to know.
1495788,eng,I don't have a good appetite.
397190,eng,Would you please close that window?
6420361,eng,Mary had to take care of Tom by herself.
8266902,eng,"It was decided to unite the national organizations in Thrace and Anatolia and to gather a united and powerful committee in Sivas, which is a reliable place to announce the voice of the nation to the world with all its luster."
2092577,eng,Does anybody here trust Tom?
736622,eng,We should always give our best.
10764986,eng,Tom can take you home.
10113882,eng,There was a muffled sound coming from the next room over. Maybe there's someone there...
6814298,eng,We're here with our children.
10644410,eng,She's on birth control pills.
271916,eng,"As in the Bible, man may not be always perfect."
6417125,eng,"Mary is just a little overweight, isn't she?"
8965878,eng,This is vegetable oil.
6494630,eng,Do you think Tom and Mary would've done that if we'd asked them to?
9199412,eng,I wish that I'd done this earlier.
3727126,eng,I can't believe Tom could be capable of this.
8182094,eng,I think that we're going to ask Tom to help us do that.
9698509,eng,She has an extravagant lifestyle.
1023815,eng,We made Tom the captain of the team.
7144037,eng,I didn't think that Tom would do that by himself.
3597391,eng,We've run out of ammunition.
1860731,eng,Find out where Tom is.
2546935,eng,Tom was late for work.
6337210,eng,I wonder if it was really necessary to do that.
2640071,eng,Tom and Mary went on a picnic with John and Alice.
3317736,eng,Spellchecking will usually catch most of your typos.
4724954,eng,Tom earns double my salary.
9774027,eng,Yanni and Skura decided to leave Algiers and start again in Mila.
2538632,eng,Tom showed Mary the book he had written.
6869336,eng,I probably should have asked Tom that question.
1649994,eng,She won a medal when she was just 15 years old.
266481,eng,More than half the residents are opposed to the plan.
41777,eng,I have no money to buy it.
7270799,eng,Sami cannot do this anymore.
6408577,eng,Mary was certain that she'd recognize Tom when she saw him.
3737277,eng,What I need is a little more money.
9485165,eng,Tom's dreams faded into nothingness.
5851861,eng,I'll do whatever it takes to be with you.
7494549,eng,Tom is never in a good mood.
4977850,eng,I know you'll be happy here.
9696323,eng,You haven't taken out the trash.
6480063,eng,Sami revealed his affair.
7385257,eng,She hasn't had her lunch yet.
7185568,eng,This is the first time that I've ridden a horse.
70403,eng,Your answer almost amounts to a threat.
8257471,eng,"She goes around Brooklyn, collecting avocado pits from Mexican restaurants and uses them in a very precise way to create a whole range of blushes and yellowy apricots and pink browns."
7733784,eng,Tom has good vision.
41064,eng,I tried to tell you.
6002332,eng,I had no idea Tom was doing that stuff.
2935225,eng,We wouldn't take such junk even as a gift.
6345396,eng,Tom is the one most likely to do that.
3424162,eng,This is very creepy.
7170498,eng,I knew that Tom would go there.
6942375,eng,Have you ever touched a snake?
7374844,eng,Mary let me know she couldn't do that.
34439,eng,That's a little out of focus.
8878305,eng,He committed suicide by throwing himself in front of the train.
7539384,eng,Tom and Mary aren't planning to go to Boston with you.
7505037,eng,Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary isn't the one who did that.
3148415,eng,I saw Tom a couple of weeks ago in Boston.
48204,eng,We have little money available for the research.
5187241,eng,I'm comfortable with it.
6240629,eng,You don't do that the same way Tom does.
660441,eng,He comes at noon.
7170631,eng,I knew that Tom wouldn't sing.
7265886,eng,Sami dropped his checkbook in Layla's car.
3592883,eng,Tom's family is missing.
6506911,eng,Tom and Mary are expecting John to do that for them.
1406052,eng,They would tell us if they knew of anything.
3422305,eng,Meet me after class.
6662542,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so sympathetic.
9926744,eng,Tom might've eaten something before he got here.
6230722,eng,I wish you hadn't told Tom I had trouble doing that.
6709968,eng,Sami and Layla had an idyllic life.
3915688,eng,I really do hate him.
3908171,eng,Tell him everything.
10737839,eng,I admire your ability to help others understand difficult concepts.
5739206,eng,We can't control all that.
288381,eng,He started learning English at the age of eleven.
6273498,eng,Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
7380201,eng,Mary nearly fell off her chair.
9755238,eng,Do you mean that I was right?
1874252,eng,Tom grabbed a letter opener off his desk.
5104526,eng,The people's opinion can change.
35228,eng,Would you like a room with a bath or a shower?
3905905,eng,I suggested that to her.
3907144,eng,I never lied to him.
7445155,eng,Tom and Mary told everyone that they were afraid.
6261712,eng,Tom has a lot to be grateful for.
3131747,eng,That does seem to happen a whole lot.
6431903,eng,Tom is never going to be given the chance to do that.
10371966,eng,"I read that Tibetans have group marriages. ""Is it true?"""
9012932,eng,"In simple terms, most programming languages are sets of instructions for computers to produce various kinds of output."
5825700,eng,I didn't let Tom in the house.
26769,eng,I was caught in the rain.
5917166,eng,Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
8588124,eng,I think Tom remembered me.
9735767,eng,I need you to step out here.
1542332,eng,Tom and Mary ate Chicken Kiev.
6569080,eng,Tom took the binoculars out of his bag.
71407,eng,"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours."
293907,eng,He has done this for profit.
10532121,eng,The ball went into the corner.
3928812,eng,The police identified Dan by his fingerprints.
1774162,eng,Is it true that in Spain there's a statue of Hernán Cortez stepping on the severed head of an Indian?
681972,eng,My cat rubbed her head against my shoulder.
1962761,eng,I don't love him.
2640912,eng,I don't know whether Tom is busy or not.
30230,eng,"At last, my turn came."
2643793,eng,You said Tom was a student.
9090369,eng,Yanni and Skura always keep their room neat.
1897850,eng,I expected better of you.
9480087,eng,Is this your tea?
3133163,eng,Do you know what's happening right now?
46927,eng,The failure is due to his carelessness.
6526941,eng,"I didn't have much fun at the party, but Tom did."
4874179,eng,It will take them some hours.
61856,eng,Something else to be borne in mind here is the rapidity with which the virus can reproduce.
449033,eng,His wound was bleeding.
1951374,eng,You can't bury the truth.
8523220,eng,Why would he decide not to go there?
7317329,eng,Sami must be a lunatic.
5394337,eng,Where did you learn all this?
4401929,eng,I can't go on like that.
7528185,eng,Who could have sent roses to Mariska?
7406407,eng,They ran back into their apartments.
3912229,eng,I want to meet him.
3122841,eng,The jewel had been stolen during the night.
2889215,eng,It's better to have no books at all than to completely trust them.
5852971,eng,I was praying.
3958692,eng,"In 1991, Eileen Collins became an astronaut."
6652780,eng,Tom said he thought that he'd be able to do that by himself.
2264871,eng,Tom has tempered the excesses of his financial risk-taking.
10558899,eng,"You should stop thinking you can do whatever you want just because you're cute. ""I think somebody's jealous!"""
7401161,eng,She said she felt very nervous.
8531749,eng,He didn't want to work with her.
2821283,eng,Tom rides his bicycle to school.
6814161,eng,You said to give it to Tom.
9809111,eng,I hope this will do some good.
3171416,eng,Tom had an odd look on his face.
274210,eng,Open the window.
3902326,eng,Tom likes to climb trees.
10485493,eng,You have a brain disease.
8400638,eng,"So far, I've been lucky."
3295532,eng,I'm 99% sure it's true.
308554,eng,The man with whom she is talking is Mr Allen.
9809448,eng,Thank you for giving me hope.
2185044,eng,To speak a foreign language is to break a boundary. To speak many languages is to break several. But to speak Esperanto is to want to break all at once.
2167,eng,"No, I cannot let you in, there's one person too many."
2245177,eng,Classes are over.
8007526,eng,Mennad doesn't matter in the world.
6504726,eng,Tom and Mary wouldn't do that if they didn't have to.
8232594,eng,My sister told me how to do it.
531868,eng,So you're a man after all.
10209650,eng,Ziri was stung by some insect.
9466391,eng,Tom didn't go to the doctor.
8799224,eng,Good morning and welcome!
7490310,eng,The dark hills in the surroundings responded with a mocking echo.
10309388,eng,How do French and German postcodes differ?
10185976,eng,Yanni never showed up.
9501431,eng,I need to tell him the news.
3820149,eng,I shouldn't have told you about that.
7278373,eng,Layla has gorgeous lips.
2406264,eng,I see you found your glasses.
8084053,eng,She left on a Monday.
10568206,eng,Tom suddenly quit.
10667520,eng,I'm grateful for the great affection you show me.
10674606,eng,"Teacher, would you punish me for something I didn't do? ""No."" ""I didn't do my homework."""
3824823,eng,This car is too expensive.
9937294,eng,"My daughter, how is it that your husband locks himself in with naked women and you have the naïveté to believe he draws them? ""But Mom, all painters need models."""
9806864,eng,I wish I'd been prepared to do that.
3286829,eng,It was probably nothing.
6231348,eng,Tom said he has something he needed to do this afternoon.
292445,eng,He came all the way from Chicago.
6310894,eng,"As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West."
58105,eng,This diver's watch is a little too expensive.
5729471,eng,Tom tried to defuse the situation.
46660,eng,The document was nowhere to be found.
10740315,eng,I don't usually get involved in anything.
7276248,eng,Sami's iPhone disappeared.
6824828,eng,"I have friends, too."
8455925,eng,"Raising a dog is like raising a child, right?"
303465,eng,He lost his temper and shouted at me.
69543,eng,You can take advantage of your free time.
7319186,eng,You better not eat that pear if you have diabetes.
2332747,eng,The law's harsh sentence is a deterrent against drinking and driving.
1741857,eng,Don't let him follow me.
327598,eng,"I feel smart today, to a degree that is in proportion to the amount of good rest I had yesterday."
2208589,eng,I've been alone for a long time.
8180203,eng,Did you think that that was what I wanted to buy?
7920444,eng,I would've remembered your smile.
2755916,eng,He didn't even dream about that.
9762927,eng,He had just gotten up and had just finished breakfast.
6915715,eng,I'll call you if anything happens.
10664968,eng,A priest is a man like any other.
2248111,eng,I'm nervous now.
9824207,eng,Yanni stormed out of the room to confront Skura.
3820926,eng,Isn't that a teacher from your school?
6344166,eng,I sure hope that Tom didn't do that.
2564661,eng,You don't need to impress me!
1152290,eng,I don't know why but ever since we met I never felt that he was a foreigner.
4496287,eng,Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should have.
6868962,eng,I know I should have gotten here earlier.
7246427,eng,Layla didn't have time for drama in college.
9662660,eng,Tom hasn't yet been potty trained.
6500970,eng,I don't think that Tom and Mary were the ones who did that.
28418,eng,I heard my name called in the dark.
2720231,eng,"He's honest, so he doesn't tell lies."
689918,eng,I do not have anything in my bag.
1295088,eng,Don't let him down.
5774001,eng,"A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife."
2399371,eng,Athletics are an important part of school life.
6497269,eng,I think Tom and Mary aren't sure that's what they have to do.
7405752,eng,She told me she's shy.
7228755,eng,I don't think that Tom will be in Boston next spring.
9800370,eng,Perhaps we can help each other.
2047137,eng,Tom hasn't made up his mind yet.
9794208,eng,Yanni failed to show up to work.
10073013,eng,You don't feel bad.
8069659,eng,I drove to Boston.
8561196,eng,Tom doesn't know much about me.
62031,eng,"Between you and me, Tom's idea doesn't appeal to me very much."
310738,eng,She is not only beautiful but also intelligent.
308552,eng,The man whom she is talking with is Mr Allen.
6501446,eng,I was surprised to learn that Tom and Mary were liberals.
9709761,eng,Many flowers are blooming in the garden.
10666125,eng,I like Tom – he's really sweet – but I don't think I could ever fall for him.
7492796,eng,There's not much difference between the two opinions.
4493856,eng,What are the symptoms of meningitis?
4488339,eng,I don't know when the party will begin.
8944365,eng,It may be difficult to get Tom to talk to you.
2906737,eng,The possibility that the two events are unconnected is not worth considering.
1127852,eng,Where I am doesn't matter.
6527621,eng,Tom and Mary are approximately the same age.
10631704,eng,I thought I'd already told you that.
9841417,eng,Try to look through others' eyes at things you are told.
6437302,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't crying.
6093955,eng,Don't you want to come?
8614293,eng,"He wants to call his puppy ""Linda."""
3177992,eng,Get a few hours sleep.
8916984,eng,These phrases seem strange to me and unclear.
6694126,eng,Sami spoke to the police.
1531032,eng,Don't forget to remind me of that.
8054229,eng,Mennad was twenty blocks from here.
7226485,eng,I don't think Tom knows why Mary doesn't like John.
10632860,eng,"I'm not completely at the mercy of my passion. In fact, I know how to control it."
7444381,eng,They told me they want to go with us.
10741331,eng,My friends all told me what they would do.
6865878,eng,"Sticky tape works as a temporary solution, but will not last long."
10648543,eng,I didn't realize that you didn't understand French?
9994186,eng,What are you going to do over the summer?
31084,eng,"If you didn't have him to exchange letters with, you would be lonely."
7804532,eng,Tom gathered his dirty clothes and put them into the laundry basket.
290683,eng,He has something to do with the robbery.
6663458,eng,"I can't change the way Tom is, but that won't stop me from trying."
10223205,eng,Rima is having contractions.
7272252,eng,Sami passed the check to me.
3312041,eng,We'll have to work on that.
10641424,eng,He was never yours.
241637,eng,Do I have to go right now?
9229991,eng,My wife's name is Mary. What's your wife's name?
8928811,eng,The new museum's worth visiting.
6224216,eng,Tom is the person who needs to do that.
1095496,eng,Tom certainly doesn't get along very well with Mary.
3729703,eng,I can make this go away.
2402170,eng,We need to get some medical supplies.
7828228,eng,Layla is Syrian.
6407750,eng,Mary wishes she could speak French as well as a native speaker.
36327,eng,Why should she have sent for him?
9956258,eng,Yanni got a little glimpse of that.
7520071,eng,Tom is doing this for his kids.
10207983,eng,Ziri is a dickhole.
7196632,eng,"You weren't surprised I didn't want to do that, were you?"
6655613,eng,"Tom seems to be really busy, doesn't he?"
2451272,eng,Tom translated the document into French.
1453598,eng,Mary is concerned with her looks.
6419065,eng,Mary wanted Tom to help her wash the car.
10231296,eng,Don't play along.
10142869,eng,It appears that Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
7775083,eng,When have you asked him to eat dinner?
8217136,eng,The horse chestnut tree is now classified as vulnerable to extinction.

8593224,eng,What're you planning to wear to the party?
7194945,eng,We took a plane from Australia to New Zealand.
6258659,eng,I was living in Boston in 2013.
8778494,eng,We all live in the same house.
6814323,eng,I'm probably not as busy as Tom.

2361939,eng,I've already been shot twice.
2458516,eng,I think you should take the job Tom is offering you.
3183890,eng,I think Tom is obese.
8336636,eng,He wants you to come outside.
680337,eng,Smoking is banned in restaurants in California.
7113473,eng,You're the only suspect.
1662425,eng,Tom is finishing his work.
932955,eng,It would be good for you to study eagerly.
6417437,eng,"Mary yelled for help, but nobody heard her."
10191609,eng,Ziri did not tell Rima why her parents got a divorce.
7131315,eng,Everything has been turned upside down.
6088878,eng,We cannot allow them to butcher us like sheep.
6660442,eng,We weren't able to help Tom.
58972,eng,This fact shows that the earth goes round the sun.
3216773,eng,We got a little bit of rain overnight.
5611739,eng,Where were you? I lost you.
6873764,eng,Tom must have been tired after working all day.
10674632,eng,She is now usually in an emotional state.
2203562,eng,I'm useless.
10237153,eng,Iran is almost impossible to conquer by land troops.
931014,eng,"When I can be of no service to the fatherland, I will at least try my best to not do any harm."
3446844,eng,Tom is reading the sports page.
10581076,eng,I get sentimental.
10025574,eng,There wasn't enough food.
10314809,eng,The car was in the middle of the road.
7139810,eng,Boston is the best place to live.
6474525,eng,Sami didn't stop the illicit relationship.
979542,eng,This phrase will be translated.
318630,eng,We happened to meet again through a strange coincidence.
9921868,eng,"In 1498, the seafarer and explorer Vasco da Gama found a route to India."
7812457,eng,So you've known all this time?
2245961,eng,I love camping.
7288555,eng,Sami doesn't know anybody here.
249092,eng,We usually have a slice of bread and a cup of coffee.
6892046,eng,"I've never met a member of that group who wasn't a terrible person. ""How would you know? Maybe you met some who were good people, but they just didn't tell you they were part of the group."""
6768202,eng,Sami watched an educational channel.
10235122,eng,Everything on the Internet is gonna be there forever.
6710883,eng,I've asked Tom not to do that here.
7475890,eng,They look like they're annoyed.
8890667,eng,"I don't understand what they're saying, but I know they're speaking French."
61768,eng,Here is the book you are looking for.
3315044,eng,"It was no big deal, really."
4493721,eng,Tom has a daughter.
3203577,eng,He has left now.
2909624,eng,I work only to go on vacation.
7275857,eng,Sami was playing all the songs that we were requesting.
4495758,eng,Tom got down on one knee and asked Mary to marry him.
302243,eng,He teaches them how to speak Japanese.
6407415,eng,Mary said that she wasn't the only one who didn't have to do that.
2714673,eng,It's four o'clock.
9999717,eng,Tom is a court reporter.
1027195,eng,Tom almost got hit by the ball.
10638163,eng,He feels a bit under the weather.
6436398,eng,Mary told me Tom was her ex-husband.
8217596,eng,Tom is a spendthrift.
7149769,eng,Tom went to Australia the day before yesterday.
6235274,eng,The only one here who needs to do that is Tom.
3920735,eng,Don't talk about us.
8618820,eng,Big Brother cares for you.
3732163,eng,I should be there by 2:30.
10759255,eng,I just came up with a new word this morning: plagiarism.
6935394,eng,Oh my God! Tom knew my name.
19557,eng,Crying is an expression of grief.
28566,eng,Bad cold is prevailing throughout the country.
8513499,eng,He'll be going to Boston with her.
6696412,eng,Sami's daughter didn't have the physical strength to overcome her father.
8434067,eng,You know who that is.
2080156,eng,Her family loved me.
6420300,eng,Mary isn't as finicky as she used to be.
6607762,eng,"These chairs aren't beautiful, but they're comfortable."
6694019,eng,Sami and Layla had an argument.
6507048,eng,I think Tom and Mary were just being sarcastic.
10081643,eng,The mouth of the river is about five kilometres north.
6890539,eng,Is it all right if I ask Tom to help me?
6806675,eng,Sami and Layla eventually became friends.
10297031,eng,Ziri wasn't giving Rima what he wanted.
1855181,eng,Are you telling me how to do my job?
5850584,eng,Mary is wearing a blue dress.
6481633,eng,Icarus flew on crafted wings.
10309785,eng,The upper parts of town enjoy a lovely view across the waterside and harbour to the sparkling bay.
7184661,eng,I've heard that Tom is planning to move to Australia.
9188585,eng,I hope that no one sits in front of us.
7391569,eng,She walked into her bedroom.
6011096,eng,That photo looks fake.
5838678,eng,The job was so routine that it left the restless Fadil wanting more.
302441,eng,He emptied the box of its contents.
7766977,eng,"Generally, the sense whether or not an expression is natural can't really be relied on. For example, even if it feels unnatural, it is often easily due to lack of experience."
5806474,eng,You'll get better at it.
3341561,eng,"Ever since Tom changed his mother-in-law's light bulbs, he's been in her good books."
9806669,eng,I'm trying to find the post office.
2047094,eng,I need to go to sleep.
3231254,eng,Did I ruin your plans?
7168172,eng,"I think that Tom didn't go jogging yesterday, but I'm not sure."
2635919,eng,I've been misunderstood.
8594206,eng,I felt like I had always lived in Algeria.
3273777,eng,Do you know why I'm sulking? Because you're never here!
297677,eng,He acted fairly toward me.
953076,eng,A lot of people are interested in camping.
6337741,eng,I couldn't attend the party.
6259860,eng,Tom said he didn't think Mary would've done that.
3037427,eng,To grasp the full significance of life is the actor's duty; to interpret it his problem; and to express it his dedication.
1885551,eng,Where did you pinch them?
10237530,eng,Ziri dated a girl from Algeria.
7734262,eng,"You'll tell me if there's a problem, won't you?"
8842982,eng,In his heart he grows the plant of longing.
10209480,eng,Ziri became a butler.
8009676,eng,Mennad stated dancing when he was in middle school.
7110799,eng,I think that Tom is incorrigible.
8744280,eng,"Shouldn't you be working? ""Actually, I am working."""
9154013,eng,There's no doubt that she has talent.
239658,eng,You are going too far.
2361318,eng,I don't like guys like that.
7510249,eng,I doubt Tom really needs to do that by himself.
1498989,eng,"This dictionary has about 40,000 entries."
1858714,eng,"Jump across the ditch. ""I will if you will."""
9814863,eng,Yanni's jumping ability is admirable.
7385769,eng,He promised to do his best.
6430705,eng,It's going to be hard to find somebody to do that for you.
10779572,eng,That hasn't happened since last September.
7441210,eng,"They aren't very spontaneous, are they?"
6724336,eng,I decided that I wouldn't do that.
10272886,eng,He had a good personality and handsome too!
2517119,eng,I'm your elder sister.
8317005,eng,He's gonna cook for you.
6493957,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't have very much money on them right now.
6512742,eng,Let's go see if Tom and Mary are at home.
327767,eng,"It's a living being, so of course it shits."
3362441,eng,You needn't have gone to all that trouble just for me.
6257039,eng,I really regret going to Boston.
9949487,eng,It makes no difference to me whether you're rich or not.
8687195,eng,Tom doesn't have a very good relationship with his family.
10225280,eng,Ziri is my favorite teacher.
9947287,eng,"You have to make a decision, and now."
4895618,eng,This is a terrible tragedy.
2288953,eng,Don't make me come back here.
9988819,eng,Efforts to bring the blaze under control using buckets soon failed.
7474014,eng,They can stay as long as they want to.
283832,eng,He was an early riser in his youth.
5894383,eng,TRAPPIST-1 is an ultra-cool dwarf star.
954434,eng,This is the first time for me to eat here.
10768665,eng,There's no way I can swim that far.
24379,eng,We have much rain in summer but on the other hand we have little rain in winter.
6456938,eng,Sami stayed put until the storm was over.
3506458,eng,Not everything Tom said was true.
7115636,eng,I work in Mandaluyong City.
6108180,eng,They were not lying.
320237,eng,The wall gave way in the earthquake.
6424429,eng,Mary told me that she's depressed.
6238800,eng,You need to be finished doing that by 2:30.
2648468,eng,No one looks busy.
9753895,eng,There were a lot of people in the pool.
6510059,eng,Tell Tom and Mary I won't go to Boston with them.
6432540,eng,It's going to be easy to find someone to do that.
1951831,eng,I can't help but feel like I've forgotten something.
434092,eng,"When Chokichi thought listlessly about this winter, and the similar winter before and the one before that, he vividly experienced the fact that as people grow older, they gradually lose their happiness."
7426759,eng,You can come over any time.
3023470,eng,Tom left for Boston yesterday.
6907444,eng,The scene would awe and terrify anyone.
9777140,eng,Yanni didn't like Skura using that drug.
18360,eng,A fool and his money are soon parted.
2471838,eng,Tom gave a bitter laugh.
10107511,eng,Algeria has a young and educated workforce.
10203276,eng,She had left the room in a flash.
10618046,eng,I hope that this doesn't happen to us again.
10784912,eng,There is a man kneeling over something on the floor.
4014353,eng,It was a genuine mistake.
8815936,eng,I had to kill Tom.
3776667,eng,You don't need to get all dressed up. It's an informal event.
6823576,eng,Tom scanned the QR code with his phone.
2372880,eng,I just realized Tom is older than Mary.
8657066,eng,"In order to find a proper solution, we need to know which constraints we face."
2144271,eng,The film I told you about has been released.
56532,eng,None of these eggs are fresh.
9868802,eng,When is Tom going to get here?
1027004,eng,Tom bought a book about cameras.
9148985,eng,"I don't need a television because if I want to see a catastrophe, I just have to look in the mirror."
2247169,eng,You have the right to consult a lawyer.
2111530,eng,Something's different.
6576043,eng,Sami was on the ground.
7440068,eng,They said they wouldn't be there.
6990499,eng,"In English, the word chat is a verb which means “to talk casually;” but in French, the word chat is the word for an animal: a cat."
9350939,eng,She was probably just in a hurry.
6651503,eng,Tom said that he was very unlikely to win.
6251314,eng,Tom isn't as rich as you think he is.
2272938,eng,Tom is an alcoholic.
2259347,eng,The maid will take it to your house.
9992295,eng,Yanni is a thief.
7376976,eng,Mary will be scolded by her father.
6067686,eng,I need toothpaste.
9463828,eng,Tom shook his head skeptically.
7587529,eng,This issue is difficult to resolve.
3725222,eng,I'm sure that would mean a lot to Tom.
9846395,eng,"My tongue is swollen, and I can't taste a thing!"
2271820,eng,I don't accept that.
3050687,eng,Stop pretending to be something you're not.
1209653,eng,There's a great difference between a theory and an idea.
3730045,eng,Tom said he was three months behind on alimony.
8563684,eng,Tom found Mary a taxi.
7537372,eng,The poison Tom put in Mary's drink wasn't enough to kill her.
273951,eng,Those are nice gloves you have on.
5075215,eng,She told my secret.
6350743,eng,Who does Tom sing with?
5636504,eng,I would have to agree with Tom.
6664718,eng,I'd like to know how long Tom plans to be in Boston.
983650,eng,This is a horse.
3752307,eng,The meeting is about to let out.
6430567,eng,Tom didn't do anything else that day.
5198243,eng,Tom now works as a dog walker.
5918976,eng,I can't write good French.
7348216,eng,Sami doesn't want to look stupid.
306384,eng,They were jumping about in excitement.
406619,eng,Which team are you a fan of?
5746197,eng,That article is rubbish.
7232059,eng,I don't think that I'll ever be able to do that by myself.
1841553,eng,We're going to another party after this one.
887382,eng,She shot him with a machine gun.
9361106,eng,"Hey, could you translate this using the word ""rage-quit""?"
7228996,eng,I don't think that Tom was drunk.
8069857,eng,Do you have your driver's license with you?
7185449,eng,I'm trying to remember the first time that I met you.
10494427,eng,The best thing about traveling is not gaining but losing. And the best thing to lose while traveling is the self.
6912241,eng,"Tom is a bit jealous, isn't he?"
10152878,eng,Tom got a credit card.
7512541,eng,I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
6448101,eng,Sami knew perfectly well what happened.
26853,eng,"When it rains, the buses are late more often than not."
7409611,eng,They help anyone that asks them.
1112669,eng,"Where are you going, Mom?"
2537129,eng,Tom has already decided what kind of job he wants to look for.
67609,eng,"In America, rice can be bought for a fifth of what it costs in Japan."
3904155,eng,I play basketball with her.
7120652,eng,I ate three eggs for breakfast.
10115165,eng,"Let's eat, Grandma."
8222797,eng,Is Algeria's oil cheap to refine?
3330967,eng,You've got a rash.
3175053,eng,Tom kept me waiting all afternoon.
8567279,eng,These towels are wonderful.
9110704,eng,You're scared of death.
8369667,eng,That noise is probably going to irritate Tom.
7437761,eng,Tom and Mary said they were broke.
10674073,eng,I'll be watching television.
6510893,eng,I doubt that Tom and Mary are still sleepy.
5746271,eng,My feelings are genuine.
7472748,eng,Tom and Mary say that they'll swim.
10382937,eng,The ham is in the fridge.
2732410,eng,He caught the ball.
7584521,eng,Tom is alone in the house.
10126157,eng,How much is Algeria investing in manufacturing?
5825789,eng,I want to tell you about what happened.
7388154,eng,He has a lot on his plate.
6256239,eng,Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that John wouldn't do that.
9966558,eng,Tom felt sleepy because he'd only slept for three hours.
6069148,eng,Do you want to know why I didn't help Tom?
9749416,eng,Yanni is feeding the goats.
9141548,eng,I hope to speak Spanish fluently in two years.
7849954,eng,It was the worst pain Mary had ever experienced.
8479828,eng,He won't be shy.
7197925,eng,Sami went to hide.
6410335,eng,Mary wanted to know who was going to help her do that.
6563869,eng,Tom warned me not to do it again.
871532,eng,"I'm a foreigner and I don't know Czech very well. Please, speak slowly."
10696189,eng,Can these people be trusted?
6517239,eng,Tom and Mary expressed themselves clearly.
3736681,eng,Tom seemed a little impatient.
2299562,eng,I brought you some fruit.
7152515,eng,Tom thought Mary would like to go to Australia to see John.
8328596,eng,Algeria has no land border with Chad.
9140016,eng,We paged Tom.
244963,eng,Sharks are infamous for their bloodthirsty natures.
1094768,eng,Tom didn't have anything to worry about.
8656698,eng,How did you end up deciding on doing a thing like this?
40108,eng,Chocolate tastes sweet.
5649470,eng,I tried talking to her about how I feel.
6414013,eng,Mary said that she was very hesitant to do that.
7178846,eng,Tom said that Mary is going to go see John.
6417948,eng,Mary is going to do that when she has time.
5851289,eng,I never want to talk about this again.
8849836,eng,Yanni was actually there.
10182571,eng,That's not how it should be done.
6620879,eng,"Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues."
67430,eng,The oak tree remained standing after the storm.
9115015,eng,Yanni flicked the light on.
7279549,eng,Sami found this so creepy.
4302402,eng,The trouble with finding love later in life is that the person you fall in love with often comes with emotional baggage.
6856903,eng,Tom has a dark past.
8532558,eng,He asked her how her father was feeling.
5165751,eng,I didn't feel safe.
10520593,eng,"Now just listen to me, OK?"
6119720,eng,I like hot coffee.
7182961,eng,I didn't want to admit that I didn't know what to do.
6092669,eng,"They only hate foreigners, while I hate everybody."
66755,eng,Let me tell you this. No one succeeded without making an effort.
6495122,eng,Tom and Mary said they hoped that John would come to their party.
6424282,eng,"Mary can't swim very well, can she?"
7177255,eng,Tom said that Mary will probably still be in Boston next Monday.
3123532,eng,We have a lot in common.
10661262,eng,"Patrick worked for the army, but was not a soldier."
10369402,eng,The girl started shaking when she saw the puppets move. She thought they were dolls that had come alive.
8265748,eng,He didn't want to come to Algeria.
9802746,eng,I don't want us to get lost!
6426736,eng,Mary is smarter than she looks.
5838706,eng,Fadil hunted around the house to find the money.
3921185,eng,Tom is all by himself.
3821003,eng,Are you sure you saw what you think you saw?
8479820,eng,He won a trophy.
10257053,eng,Trout are caught in this river.
6310219,eng,His clothes hung baggily over his shrivelled limbs.
5584344,eng,Tom has been so good.
5134187,eng,Where can I throw these egg shells?
8607789,eng,Tom is not Trump.
7544644,eng,Tom sat behind me.
6301569,eng,Did they ever read this book?
6428205,eng,Mary looks like she's alone.
8797636,eng,"The son of a once-influential and wealthy Hong Kong family who lost their fortune in the Great Depression of the 1930s, Stanley Ho escaped to Macau during World War Two when Japanese forces captured Hong Kong."
10222942,eng,Rima let the baby cry.
7211658,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary was anxious.
1079067,eng,New plants grow in the garden in spring.
6586756,eng,Sun streamed into the room from the window.
3724252,eng,You live next to somebody I work with.
1125587,eng,Cut the crap!
7388852,eng,She's concerned about her safety.
1490665,eng,This is the park where we said our last goodbye.
10585683,eng,About how many customers came into your shop today?
9218480,eng,I really like tulips.
7380356,eng,"Mary is moving away, isn't she?"
2763402,eng,Tom looked angry when Mary said that.
7110614,eng,I think you're cool.
1961647,eng,I thought you might like to know who's coming to our party.
1665066,eng,"I know dirty jokes, but I don't tell them."
8474814,eng,He knows better than to fight with you.
2326538,eng,I folded my shirts and put them in my suitcase.
3735862,eng,Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
1513244,eng,Tom was plastered.
8015451,eng,I want to know if you remember me.
8597199,eng,The towels have kept their colors.
6409154,eng,Mary used the money Tom gave her to buy something to eat.
4426581,eng,The old professor's lectures are long-winded and ponderous.
24501,eng,Thousands of Americans have a hard time keeping the wolf from the door.
6352948,eng,Tom looked like he was done.
5285995,eng,Look! The train is there!
7394216,eng,He says he enjoys teaching French.
8860319,eng,Room service is an amenity we can live without.
7516367,eng,Tom and I both know that you did that.
72346,eng,See you a little past 7.
314677,eng,She looked her child in the face.
10211047,eng,Ziri purchased a computer.
259760,eng,I am going to see the sights of Nara.
38688,eng,Let's check why your answers differ from mine.
7439752,eng,They said they could do that today.
7984803,eng,Why were you living in Boston last year?
9749432,eng,Yanni doesn't have a large number of goats.
7383504,eng,He corrected himself.
6499104,eng,I think Tom and Mary might get in trouble if they do that.
7242190,eng,Sami took a screenshot of Layla's text message.
311125,eng,She could hardly keep from laughing when she saw the dress.
8541626,eng,I'd rather not do that with you.
1762002,eng,Where did you put her picture?
3731034,eng,Who's going to check with Tom?
6676822,eng,Tom doesn't play the guitar very well.
4828803,eng,"Once you make it to the end, it's okay for you to cry."
6416457,eng,Mary had enough money to buy what she wanted.
1181133,eng,Tom never wanted to get a divorce.
5288171,eng,Owlets are cute.
6522847,eng,Tom and Mary say they need help.
8375306,eng,Tom seemed impressed by Mary's skill.
10244465,eng,"The queen can live for several years, with an average productive life span of two to three years."
9033842,eng,Tom wasn't smoking his pipe.
6506528,eng,I didn't know that Tom and Mary were doing that.
1251244,eng,The hotel spared no expense in the design of its presidential suite.
10102067,eng,Next year come sooner!
10764599,eng,Ziri got to the trail.
3565859,eng,Is it true what they say about Tom?
4438110,eng,Mary is a fairy princess.
2642669,eng,Tom got into the car with Mary.
6526017,eng,Tom promised Mary he wouldn't say anything about what happened.
5051639,eng,We all wanted revenge.
9497770,eng,Would you say you're hardworking?
10210090,eng,Ziri became a dustman.
3819496,eng,Maybe we should do this together.
10235587,eng,Ziri kept thinking about it.
8200293,eng,I traveled to different parts of the Muslim world.
238464,eng,The comic scenes in the play were overdone.
2307563,eng,Whom did you vote for in the election?
10297030,eng,Ziri didn't date Rima. She was just a hookup.
6274498,eng,Tom is retired now.
4016319,eng,Perhaps we should find out what Tom's doing.
6266936,eng,Tom doesn't appear to be busy.
3200991,eng,"Of course, I have to tell Tom."
2366741,eng,"Now listen, children."
2646836,eng,Tom was at the hotel.
3825539,eng,Run for cover.
3599243,eng,He speaks well.
242586,eng,There is nothing interesting in the newspaper today.
3818742,eng,Call me what you want.
6223155,eng,Tom said he doesn't like doing that.
10551926,eng,She left him.
2095441,eng,Did somebody mention my name?
6497934,eng,Tom and Mary were told not to try to do that by themselves.
2638936,eng,I thought that you were going to talk about this with Tom.
3492719,eng,We need to go shopping.
2451,eng,Who are those guys?
10729025,eng,Tom and Mary were both completely exhausted.
6491805,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary are broke.
9611709,eng,Isn't anyone interested?
2892570,eng,What do you think they were doing?
9528289,eng,Did Tom write a letter?
291888,eng,The intention that he is watching a television is nonexistent.
10029601,eng,Today is the twelfth of August.
7214210,eng,Tom told me that he tried to win.
7389851,eng,She locked her keys in the car.
6246292,eng,I'll remember today as long as I live.
4837198,eng,Tom's eyes were glued to the screen.
8309636,eng,I wanted to meet Tom's family.
7299522,eng,Sami asked Layla to go on another date with him.
7148967,eng,Sami doesn't work here.
2721774,eng,I will move out of my parents' house.
1498630,eng,Did you know you are stronger than you think you are?
274396,eng,I built my son a new house.
7812417,eng,Tom felt like he had been punched in the gut.
303987,eng,He arrived safely.
9176678,eng,This is a jar.
7443705,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they needed our help.
7734316,eng,I wasn't sure if I wanted Tom to do that.
44394,eng,The girl is lonely.
7922954,eng,Learning any language requires some effort and free time.
7840257,eng,"My cousins still live in Kabylie, Algeria."
8023709,eng,Let's sit on that log over there.
7510736,eng,I know that Tom isn't much older than Mary is.
6491293,eng,Maybe Tom and Mary don't know they're not supposed to do that.
6700572,eng,Sami would do anything to stop that divorce.
6502956,eng,Tom and Mary don't remember what happened that night.
3912569,eng,Something made him angry.
26966,eng,The rain was dripping through a leak in the roof.
3727480,eng,It's just good manners.
9793918,eng,Yanni began to sweat.
6651488,eng,Tom said that he was willing to help us out.
3409251,eng,Tom used to be skinny.
6412670,eng,Mary says she didn't know Tom wanted to eat pizza.
6119654,eng,Mary is an anti-fascist.
3182042,eng,Tom told me I didn't have to talk to you.
6698522,eng,Tom's father isn't as old as Mary's father.
5754459,eng,Start the countdown.
6375689,eng,Sami will pay dearly for what he did.
8818050,eng,I saw Tom's car.
8375485,eng,Tom has been very nice to all Mary's friends.
687438,eng,What type of job are you looking for?
1845802,eng,Did you ever hear anything like it?
9839165,eng,I recently started smoking again.
10488591,eng,It's really a very simple matter.
260384,eng,I liked him all the better for his faults.
48234,eng,The dog went away like a shot.
1344001,eng,"Mammy, you are an exploiter!"
7033130,eng,"Do you have any special talents, powers or abilities?"
3477477,eng,Tom must've found out that I was here.
2956252,eng,Tom can't cook very well.
6003793,eng,I don't know anything about Australia.
9243163,eng,I used to know a man like you.
6647719,eng,Tom says he's too tired to study.
3171293,eng,Tom is very fast.
6177359,eng,Someone other than Sami has cashed his paycheck.
5193365,eng,I want you to know all this.
10209951,eng,Ziri is a Christian Zionist.
55978,eng,You can keep this one for yourself.
323498,eng,"Can I see your license, please?"
4529282,eng,That's really quite an accomplishment.
3152854,eng,Do you have any idea why Tom gave it to you?
1283611,eng,Don't leave evidence.
7948155,eng,Let's hang out again.
8748693,eng,He paused near Tom's chair.
6376548,eng,This product is still so new here.
1205980,eng,What is your favorite classic rock song?
10131576,eng,Tom warmed up a can of ravioli for dinner.
7401897,eng,He said that he wasn't sure.
7851561,eng,Tom acted like he was not interested.
7970066,eng,Sami and Layla have the same friends.
8973534,eng,"This film's getting too silly for me. Let's switch over, Tom."
285311,eng,"I don't know any more about him. I know him, but only to say hello to."
7735151,eng,I couldn't tell Tom what was happening.
7182373,eng,Tom said that he had nothing to talk about.
7371418,eng,Mary is a good listener.
764171,eng,How can you be sure your girlfriend isn't faking her orgasms?
20435,eng,It is not my intention to return.
10119855,eng,The fireworks yesterday were so pretty.
7515016,eng,I think that I'd be fired if I did that.
2218410,eng,You're still involved.
7173577,eng,I thought that you did that really well.
6435693,eng,Tom didn't want to talk to the police.
7905430,eng,All birds have feathers.
413589,eng,"According to research by Gunnar Samuelsson, Jesus may not have died on a cross. Instead, it's possible that he died on a pole or a tree trunk."
6360622,eng,The sky has become cloudy.
10736964,eng,Tom has just been paid.
6658335,eng,"Tom isn't married, but Mary is."
6125083,eng,Tom didn't let Mary in the house.
3096034,eng,Tom wasn't willing to cooperate.
464212,eng,This street is in Paris.
7071661,eng,Tom has more toys than Mary.
3272652,eng,She is not a fan of winter sports.
7196531,eng,Tom was surprised that anybody else was there.
291370,eng,"He said he knew the famous actress, which was a lie."
7114255,eng,I can't ignore it.
2111696,eng,I'm reformed.
3736041,eng,Children often imitate their parents.
6336859,eng,I wonder whether Tom is really broke.
5487780,eng,Tom said that he would have called you later.
6113990,eng,Why did Tom decide to do that?
7184704,eng,"In 2013, Tom was a student in Australia."
2762807,eng,I'm hungover.
57873,eng,There are many questionable points in this ledger.
4108214,eng,He lied brazenly.
6511852,eng,I think Tom and Mary are going to be fine.
3199925,eng,Tell me it's not true.
4970486,eng,Tom had flu-like symptoms.
6379460,eng,"At the start of the 20th century, children were often employed in factories."
279219,eng,I left my hat as I got off the train.
5748409,eng,I've always said that.
3436669,eng,The question is how.
6243184,eng,Tom could get up to three years in prison.
7155336,eng,Tom sold all his property in Australia.
6576890,eng,I'm lacking something.
1514263,eng,What would you say in this context?
8572722,eng,I can't tell you anything about that.
73761,eng,"Let's go to the movies, shall we? ""Yes, let's."""
6107127,eng,Layla was stripped of her innocence.
8498192,eng,Tom liked her.
3241663,eng,"Save me a seat, won't you?"
8821601,eng,I see smoke.
64488,eng,I will help you if you are in trouble.
6410366,eng,Mary told Tom that she thought John wasn't suspicious.
2011704,eng,Tom doesn't want that.
6503675,eng,I think Tom and Mary are acting a little suspicious.
8737615,eng,They have lived happily since they were married.
3312932,eng,We'd better take a look.
7932410,eng,You are a very nice person.
9869906,eng,What do you think of off-shore drilling?
8535344,eng,She's a bad influence on him.
10153863,eng,The city is very close. You can get there by bike.
9949941,eng,Yanni didn't tell Skura that.
9150033,eng,Have you seen my key?
8988741,eng,Tom probably isn't going to come tomorrow.
6221202,eng,Tom is also going to do that today.
8796615,eng,Yanni and Skura needed surgery.
6492409,eng,"The last time I spoke to Tom and Mary, they said they weren't planning to go to Boston."
2547547,eng,Tom swam in the pool.
6457954,eng,How is it you speak with such a stutter?
3730743,eng,Isn't it infuriating?
3129754,eng,Don't worry. These things happen.
5288084,eng,Human relationships are very complex.
8945933,eng,Somebody has to take over.
7246808,eng,Sami was kind of rude.
256691,eng,I kept company with him since we were students.
6807342,eng,Sami walked closer to the cash register.
8085799,eng,I wasn't in only foreigner living in Kabylie.
6107814,eng,Layla was disgusted by Sami.
2389855,eng,I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
1122134,eng,It's your turn to do the washing up. I did it yesterday.
7127075,eng,Tom found out where Mary worked.
7993946,eng,Tom went to the supermarket to buy a cake mix.
6528726,eng,Tom has both experience and knowledge.
5737401,eng,I ask myself that every day.
1829013,eng,He didn't have anything to say to the teacher.
21888,eng,It is interesting to make friends with a foreigner.
2488864,eng,Tom isn't used to city life.
9483546,eng,This is what we were afraid would happen.
2861570,eng,"You need a towel, don't you?"
5734773,eng,There are no obvious answers.
7470579,eng,Tom and Mary swore that they'd never hit me again.
1867803,eng,Tom walked toward the entrance.
7278589,eng,Sami had a black cat.
2931759,eng,Mary wanted to write.
1027474,eng,I wish I had as much energy as Tom.
3123084,eng,It looks like Tom is asleep.
4012113,eng,When was the last time you had a vacation?
283751,eng,He came to my rescue.
2971712,eng,"The boys' room is on the right, and the girls' room is on the left."
6225641,eng,That isn't the main reason why Tom ought to do that.
6408951,eng,Mary said she doesn't think Tom wants to do that tomorrow.
6424440,eng,Mary told me that she was puzzled.
5737708,eng,"OK Tom, how many do you want?"
6226856,eng,Tom says he doesn't know where Mary is planning on doing that.
1024254,eng,Tom said he'd never leave his wife.
8816850,eng,I've been busy getting ready for the party.
51495,eng,"Excuse me, but we're in a hurry, too."
7194387,eng,Everyone except Tom knew he didn't have to stay in Australia.
5958520,eng,I refuse to give up.
2539905,eng,I don't have a lot of time for this.
699465,eng,I'm 18 years old.
4499530,eng,I met a man from Boston this afternoon.
4017209,eng,Did Tom seem upset about anything?
9728811,eng,This semester is important.
3023205,eng,What happened to Tom in Boston?
7731995,eng,Tom said he wanted to sit next to Mary.
2326741,eng,The skaters skated around the rink.
5687025,eng,"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
10785413,eng,"Oh. How was the test? Do you think you'll get the credits? ""No. There's no way. I'll be going in a suit to make a plea to the professor tomorrow."""
10465494,eng,We'll continue to work on this.
6088006,eng,Tom thought Mary was a French teacher.
321550,eng,I'm sure about his name.
2947829,eng,He's not as innocent as he seems.
9462388,eng,The castle's guards were armed with bows and arrows.
5521802,eng,"We skirted green hills, which sparkled in the first rays of sunshine."
3385892,eng,He's just angry because we're having so much fun.
7387900,eng,He gave his seat to the old woman.
846824,eng,I love you more than I love any other person.
9086279,eng,How wide must the gap be between the wall tiles?
2273678,eng,Tom was breathing heavily.
7390473,eng,He put the phone to his ear.
9371623,eng,There's no way I'm giving up my bed for him.
8970052,eng,I understand the rules of the game.
288486,eng,He will be waiting for you about two o'clock.
59260,eng,The population of this country is smaller than that of the United States.
30118,eng,"If you sit back and rest, you will feel much better."
9514830,eng,Stop panicking!
4761317,eng,Is there anything that worries you right now?
8855617,eng,Tom often doesn't get home until very late.
8419166,eng,I bought his last novel.
6942414,eng,Tom isn't the only one who thinks that's going to happen.
10261272,eng,It was stupid to take that risk in vain.
4999716,eng,I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
6658635,eng,You don't seem to be as disorganized as Tom seems to be.
7242407,eng,Sami was at a bachelor party.
8052879,eng,Mennad instantly got mad.
1979236,eng,I lived in poverty.
8382257,eng,Tom can't write or read.
253773,eng,I beat him at golf.
9373400,eng,"Tom won't say anything, even if they torture him."
3135863,eng,I had nothing to do with what happened last night.
2714042,eng,Do you speak Irish?
3727157,eng,You shouldn't get involved with this.
7794550,eng,I've suffered as much as you.
4813034,eng,Why don't you follow your diet?
10628412,eng,This idiot can't even speak his own language!
10013804,eng,This virus is a problem all over the world.
4787530,eng,Are we starting?
6887134,eng,Is Tom good at playing golf?
7505265,eng,I know Tom didn't know that I'd never done that before.
4537436,eng,I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
246628,eng,This is the last time I'll ask you to do anything for me.
64046,eng,I met your father once.
4665772,eng,I've never had a steady job.
7303508,eng,Sami didn't come.
8947112,eng,Tom won't need to wait here.
7378920,eng,Mary leaned forward in her chair.
3955446,eng,"The surface temperature on the side of Mercury closest to the Sun reaches 427 degrees Celsius, a temperature hot enough to melt tin. On the side facing away from the Sun, or the night side, the temperature drops to -183 degrees Celsius."
39141,eng,Television viewers see only what the camera shows.
4625841,eng,It is bad to count all the things that you gave.
3818661,eng,Throw down your weapons.
2358976,eng,I have an aunt and uncle in Boston.
1142214,eng,Every man in the kingdom fell under the spell of her look.
6451365,eng,Sami prayed five times a day.
10155868,eng,Tom's explanation wasn't really clear.
4867946,eng,It's dangerous to study.
6490453,eng,Tom and Mary said they weren't planning to go swimming tomorrow.
6225935,eng,That wasn't the main reason why Tom needed to do that.
3734664,eng,My real name is Tom.
248975,eng,We walked along the river.
9774631,eng,Yanni wants to keep up the life that he lives.
8529261,eng,"He's kind of standoffish, isn't he?"
3906349,eng,I never got to talk to her.
263743,eng,An accident often comes of carelessness.
5333552,eng,Starting to speak and making mistakes is a lot better than to keep silent in resignation.
7177292,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't planning on doing that by herself.
3484759,eng,He's reading a novel right now.
7377458,eng,"Mary is still too young, isn't she?"
5729876,eng,Tom began to work before sunrise.
6767407,eng,I'm going to graduate next spring.
4663198,eng,Tom will never be able to keep this a secret.
318286,eng,I have forgotten to bring something to write with.
8324796,eng,There is a centipede in the kitchen.
5916795,eng,Tom isn't much taller than me.
303099,eng,"He was ill, so he lay in bed all day long."
9819850,eng,What's the most unusual pet you've ever seen?
8032761,eng,Mennad needs to do something that would entertain his mind.
3636731,eng,My mother hates watching the television.
3201643,eng,That's why I told you about this.
4877603,eng,Dan checked the weather forecast before taking off.
8562592,eng,"In the 1990s, Algeria had countless security checkpoints."
305604,eng,They stopped their game and stared at me.
1652286,eng,You've got a cute friend.
2946845,eng,None of these words is written correctly.
4006788,eng,Welcome to Tatoeba.
6647005,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary had been hurt.
6422351,eng,Mary said that she'd be here by 2:30.
10158152,eng,Yanni was captivated by Rima's beauty.
434206,eng,"An envelope and a stamp, please."
8015570,eng,I want you both to go to Australia with me.
260739,eng,I threatened to reveal his secret.
8597947,eng,Try to stay positive.
5298846,eng,I was forced to sell my car.
6855642,eng,I want to know everything there is to know about you.
238766,eng,What's the reading on the blood pressure monitor?
10026266,eng,Yanni read Skrua's resume.
57510,eng,This box is three times as big as that one.
6842766,eng,Tom doesn't like walking.

4235695,eng,What's all the commotion about?
9471932,eng,It's an exciting time of the year.
8152799,eng,He gets up every morning at eight.
6354883,eng,Tom thinks you can't win.
8477806,eng,He had no fear.
611769,eng,You don't need to call me.
10146136,eng,Tom has decided to have his house repainted.
8319163,eng,That's his father-in-law.
297315,eng,He was displeased with my coming.
60468,eng,This straight road will lead you to the post office.
10088129,eng,Algeria needs to reduce inflation.
7212530,eng,It's obvious Tom knows what he's doing.
8348102,eng,We are satisfied.
5538487,eng,We have until 2:30 p.m. Monday.
8219042,eng,Tom rapped on the window.
3401923,eng,Tom put his arm around the young woman.
4960684,eng,What do they call him?
4451737,eng,They enjoy the benefits of a great reputation.
6854509,eng,Mary's boyfriend is older than her father.
6337835,eng,Everyone knows Tom did that.
2064785,eng,I have to tell you something.
9951598,eng,There are a large number of shops and businesses in the neighbourhood.
6648700,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary needed to eat healthier food.
32384,eng,Mayuko wore a flower crown.
268094,eng,The floor was swimming with blood.
4666042,eng,I don't consider this safe.
7748856,eng,I speak Berber to my children.
3200082,eng,Tom told Mary to go away.
4089808,eng,Money is the god of the human race.
2587530,eng,Have you come to save me?
7222661,eng,Let's hope that that doesn't happen.
1024029,eng,Tom wants a large family.
7149755,eng,Tom wished he were with Mary back in Australia.
6660661,eng,I should've told Tom to not talk to Mary anymore.
8830448,eng,I have to edit the report.
7212406,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary had been reasonable.
3724339,eng,I'm not doing anything behind your back.
3910234,eng,I must see them.
10093955,eng,He treats them like chattel.
8409338,eng,Is this your Kabyle dress?
5629422,eng,Dan came back after spending two months in Scotland.
7127806,eng,Tom couldn't get his trousers off.
8110792,eng,Tom and Mary announced their engagement yesterday.
5844810,eng,I hope I'll be able to do that.
6497981,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they thought John was downstairs.
2272870,eng,Tom is a sculptor.
286724,eng,"His novels are, for the most part, very boring."
9975738,eng,"The windshield is in the sun, drying."
9019953,eng,Karl seems to be alone.
2387733,eng,I need to speak to Tom immediately.
6243357,eng,I don't know where Tom parked the car.
10767204,eng,He would also like to come.
9150042,eng,We're seniors at Harvard.
8684721,eng,How bad is the SDE on the HTC Vive?
7376769,eng,Mary is a doctor like her father is.
6788308,eng,Here's a pillow you can use.
2649730,eng,We finally forced Tom to admit it.
308660,eng,"Give her these roses, and she will be pleased."
7199782,eng,I promised Tom that I wouldn't tell anybody.
6512736,eng,Let's see if Tom and Mary have any ideas.
6174893,eng,I need a kip.
6259456,eng,Tom doesn't plan to go to college.
2766929,eng,There are some magazines in my room.
7863589,eng,He's really good at speaking Berber.
3908046,eng,Tell him it's an emergency.
9049510,eng,Tom was able to get what he wanted.
7734605,eng,Tom is back from the gym.
10158539,eng,Rima suffered a miscarriage.
9320719,eng,The eggplant was great.
3726132,eng,Tom is beyond help.
7507779,eng,The reason Tom came was because Mary asked him to.
7173115,eng,I thought that Tom would be excited.
10067730,eng,That's a lot of waffles.
5468704,eng,Tom should be scolded.
8071306,eng,I wanted Tom to go home.
1748872,eng,"Bite down, please."
9230205,eng,I have my reasons for doing this.
6229090,eng,I should ask Tom to do that.
6527574,eng,Tom is approximately the same height as you.
5106397,eng,Tom objected to that.
2241176,eng,We must obey.
7206270,eng,Layla didn't lose her virginity until she was sixteen.
6411498,eng,Mary said she wanted to get out of town for a while.
7873901,eng,I just got off the train and I'm still on the platform.
10532383,eng,"A draw yesterday, another draw today. Carlsen 1, Nepo 1. Will we have a winner tomorrow?"
6325416,eng,Why don't you help me pay some bills?
8530653,eng,Mary has a dog.
10721795,eng,I take off my hat to you.
1886673,eng,What's your greatest fear?
435414,eng,I wonder if keeping your head down and living safely is a survival instinct.
6523607,eng,Tom didn't want to tell anyone about what he'd done.
543686,eng,I am not able to do that because I don't have enough money.
8591328,eng,"By insulting some of Algeria's heroes of independence, fascists like Noureddine Khettal and Naima Salhi are dishonoring Algeria's past."
6411830,eng,I asked Mary if she wanted to go to a movie with me.
6247067,eng,I almost never do that in the evening.
267971,eng,The boy liked to keep his pencils sharp.
3394427,eng,All the crew left except for Tom.
308144,eng,I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet.
10715875,eng,Tom is the best dancer here.
2662811,eng,We need to find out what caused the problem.
8069305,eng,"Could you hurry, please?"
6465371,eng,Our fridge is empty.
4666628,eng,The fire has burned out.
6416611,eng,I should tell Mary that she needs to do that.
7973842,eng,"And the women said to Noemi: Blessed be the Lord, who hath not suffered thy family to want a successor: that his name should be preserved in Israel."
6658531,eng,Tom is the rudest person I've ever met.
3906654,eng,I want to go talk to them.
9967817,eng,Yanni has a deep scratch on his windshield.
7211632,eng,Tom told me that he thought Mary was unbeatable.
6521853,eng,Tom and Mary are almost broke.
8442588,eng,I want Tom to invite Mary and John over for dinner.
2855301,eng,You can smell the chocolate from outside!
5168351,eng,I wish Tom wouldn't talk to me so much.
6659266,eng,I don't think I really need to read this.
6229995,eng,I want to do that with Tom.
3416809,eng,"Tom is tidy, isn't he?"
2026448,eng,That's exactly what they want us to do.
2361931,eng,I'm sure you won't disappoint me.
7856962,eng,Algeria is a former socialist country.
248097,eng,We saw the old building pulled down.
7017805,eng,"On a recent weekday afternoon in Ho Chi Minh City, the passengers bouncing along on one of the city's green buses breathed in mouthfuls of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other chemicals that add to Vietnam's notorious pollution. The toxic smoke did not come from the bus itself, but from the man driving it — one hand supporting the wheel, the other holding a cigarette."
7317743,eng,Sami was trying to be patient.
9966785,eng,What do you have in the trunk of your car?
811554,eng,Are you looking for a definite article?
887562,eng,She was the first one to help him.
6246323,eng,I don't know any of Tom's children.
10520540,eng,Tom was still talking to Mary when I left.
6251126,eng,It would've been unsafe to do that.
1981480,eng,There's something important I need to tell him.
280631,eng,"I'd like to turn off the reading lamp, is that OK?"
39604,eng,There is a vase on the table.
6108849,eng,I'm going to stop trying.
3426447,eng,Am I really that fascinating?
7178926,eng,Tom said that Mary has never seen John swim.
6133925,eng,"We can do everything to men who love us, they are so stupid."
10064532,eng,Yanni really believed it was Skura.
271370,eng,It seems that the government wants to separate these three.
6507099,eng,Tom and Mary will do whatever they can to help you.
2407145,eng,I swear I'll stop you.
2375905,eng,I know how hard it's been.
8398490,eng,She's texting men.
2028600,eng,Do you want me to pick up Tom after school?
6043405,eng,Layla was reluctant to move back to Cairo.
1343185,eng,He lives in the yellow house.
1751621,eng,He knows how to iron his shirts.
6275974,eng,You distract me by pacing up and down.
2148537,eng,The lack of a public sphere in Europe is being felt more and more keenly.
8871731,eng,I'm not good for you.
6663985,eng,Tom isn't as angry as I am.
6439675,eng,Tom is going to cooperate.
7199566,eng,You promised that you'd do that before you went home.
7970151,eng,Sami wanted to make out with that girl.
6341310,eng,Tom didn't seem to be interested in doing that.
2778316,eng,Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
5828516,eng,"Don't go yet, please."
8535050,eng,She'll meet him today.
2942460,eng,Let all your dreams come true.
6524897,eng,Both Tom and Mary were drunk last night when I saw them.
4665149,eng,We'll continue to support Tom.
1815536,eng,Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Arabian Peninsula.
9666090,eng,They're reading the text.
8789797,eng,"When she finally decided to appear on the stage, the public greeted her with whistles."
6499155,eng,This is the first time Tom and Mary have ever complained about the weather.
6263943,eng,Tom said Mary knew he might need to do that.
10677608,eng,Ziri lives in a 1940 house.
6243074,eng,I think I know why Tom didn't do that.
7163798,eng,I was arrested in Australia.
10722116,eng,That will encourage radish leaf growth instead of root development.
10533485,eng,I saw that movie last month when I was in Boston.
9241359,eng,Yanni quickly opened the door and hopped into the car.
3178382,eng,"You're pretty rich, aren't you?"
6870370,eng,It could have been better.
6422216,eng,Mary told Tom that she was irritated.
6583808,eng,No salesmen will call.
10040982,eng,Yanni is overdoing it.
6407779,eng,Mary says she doesn't know whether she'll have time to do that.
4222448,eng,My children don't have their own rooms.
6224270,eng,Tom said that's not his biggest concern.
3332948,eng,"Are you familiar with ""Muzzy in Gondoland""?"
2243657,eng,They're not sure.
10646452,eng,I was totally devastated by his loss.
9763252,eng,I didn't realize what was happening at first.
10685479,eng,We expect prices to go up in the near future.
1028716,eng,Tom has no idea where Mary lives.
5588332,eng,What did Tom show you?
10770391,eng,Don't scatter the cattle.
7390417,eng,He predeceased his father.
10074953,eng,I think most of them are benevolent but misguided.
8557105,eng,Tom thinks that he'll never fall in love.
8532568,eng,He invited her and her friends to dinner.
10024103,eng,"In a platonic relationship, there is no jealousy."
9974541,eng,She's rung.
9359575,eng,"Turn off the kitchen light, please."
6268748,eng,What movie did you watch?
2543659,eng,I'll help you any way I can.
2928014,eng,"I don't know exactly where I left my keys, but I think they're on the dining room table."
6657079,eng,Do Tom and I still have to do that?
9793302,eng,I told Tom you were working.
10235503,eng,China wants to fully retake Taiwan.
6336350,eng,I wonder if Tom was at school today.
1719247,eng,I cannot mix chilli with my food.
5189242,eng,Tom used to visit me all the time.
7735678,eng,We were ordered not to take prisoners.
8226811,eng,I only walked about three kilometers today.
8514742,eng,She kept her gun trained on him.
6137888,eng,"Forwards always, backwards never."
6787805,eng,Did you know that already?
2546041,eng,I'll tell Tom you asked.
3238975,eng,I thought we'd be safer here.
3000869,eng,Tom is quite accident-prone and had his third accident in as many months just the other day.
6654957,eng,Tom said that he didn't have one of these yet.
8127351,eng,Mennad doesn't own a car.
8012638,eng,Mennad did that better.
1095557,eng,Tom can't seem to access his data.
7205581,eng,I can assure you that I'm not going to do that.
8106838,eng,Tom put the box on the table and opened it.
6538125,eng,Sami was released on bail.
8922265,eng,I'll let you check on that.
8537029,eng,She asked me to do her homework for her.
3536334,eng,I wonder if I should tell her the truth.
6514340,eng,Tom and Mary are absent because they're sick.
43919,eng,I read the book in my second year of high school.
6353402,eng,Tom and Mary were very good friends in high school.
2546952,eng,Tom threw Mary a kiss.
6968947,eng,Tom spoke to the pastor for three hours.
8717458,eng,Are you sure everything will go well?
10242824,eng,How do fish survive in water?
9092732,eng,"By the way, what are you doing after this?"
3046971,eng,Tom is very resourceful.
7132307,eng,Tom and I are happy here.
5936328,eng,"I'm wearing a new pair of shoes today, so I don't want to walk too far."
2218244,eng,You aren't dying.
7541856,eng,Tom would do anything you ask him to do.
6433597,eng,Tom said that Mary isn't allowed to do that.
6375298,eng,You're on your way to hell.
271867,eng,The students bowed to their teacher.
2077962,eng,Has anyone here in the classroom heard about Norman Finkelstein?
7400722,eng,She thinks she's a good driver.
5226786,eng,Who are you going to give these books to?
2627942,eng,I played soccer and my sister played tennis.
8778427,eng,He wants another six liters of gasoline.
72565,eng,Can you lend me 500 yen?
8514858,eng,She lost her temper and shouted at him.
8623236,eng,New York’s mayor called on U.S. President Donald Trump to deploy military personnel to his city.
6421921,eng,"Mary doesn't give up easily, does she?"
9086962,eng,"This part doesn't work. It's in good condition, but it's not the right size."
6242252,eng,I don't remember asking Tom to do that.
6228780,eng,"You weren't the one who asked Tom to do that, were you?"
1152247,eng,I bought a magazine in a store.
6646528,eng,Tom told me he's seen that movie three times.
6786185,eng,I painted the house.
9771368,eng,Figs contain a good amount of potassium.
6902714,eng,"Tom is a bright boy, isn't he?"
7935351,eng,How can I get Mary to fall in love with me?
6580972,eng,"Yo, dog..."
5571702,eng,Tom said he liked snow.
4816849,eng,We imagine the impression others have of us.
10787744,eng,I've been ill.
10619529,eng,Ziri's company went solar.
6270603,eng,Tom didn't like what Mary was doing.
8745983,eng,Do you like it hot or cold?
6582657,eng,Mary unfastened the hooks on her bra.
953865,eng,I'm tired of talking to you about this.
1094909,eng,Tom definitely meant what he said.
7136478,eng,I think the time has come for us to do that.
6340200,eng,It looks like Tom is determined to do that.
8909667,eng,Plan B seems to be better than Plan A.
254448,eng,"I tried to answer the question, which I found impossible."
6531318,eng,I got the job I applied for.
10356856,eng,Tom cannot beat me.
8656215,eng,I take courses on the weekends.
1095705,eng,Tom called Mary to ask why she wasn't at the party.
4498919,eng,"Tom gave me a nice set of aluminum wheels, but he kept the tires."
9066656,eng,Yanni sat in the kitchen with a hammer.
7538964,eng,There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about Tom.
7543237,eng,Tom sometimes mispronounces words.
2031550,eng,I want Tom to have a chance for a decent life.
7394161,eng,She says she wants to talk with you.
5300597,eng,I hardly ever talk to Tom anymore.
2033814,eng,I want you all to know that I'll never change.
6522758,eng,Do Tom and Mary wear boots?
1559957,eng,One should add a full stop at the end of the sentence.
10187642,eng,Can you help me translate?
255527,eng,I love French films.
7391019,eng,She sold her company.
1495104,eng,She hasn't made it yet.
7292042,eng,Mary had a bad dream.
10225891,eng,Rima had no idea Ziri was such a romantic.
7194739,eng,Tom should be glad that's going to happen.
6768878,eng,Tom's a cokehead.
7439613,eng,They said that they need to do that.
8586035,eng,Tom drove his dad's car to the park.
3151390,eng,It gave me an idea.
4368168,eng,What do you think about this outfit?
4057612,eng,I forgot that I was supposed to be there yesterday.
9601837,eng,Why don't you ask for a raise?
2301951,eng,I can't believe your parents let you come here by yourself.
3235883,eng,A sharp pain shot through Tom's body and he slumped to the ground.
6519578,eng,I thought Tom and Mary were wrong.
10296590,eng,Ziri seemed really nice.
7375423,eng,Mary said that she wanted to do more.
10638005,eng,"He who thinks is. The contrapositive thereof is: he who is not does not think. But does the converse of this hold as well: that he who does not think is not? ""That rock over there does not think, and yet it is."""
3071740,eng,"I know the tune, but I don't know the words."
328827,eng,"Thanks, please come again."
7870181,eng,Please tell me exactly what you really want.
5990560,eng,Birds are hot blooded.
7378052,eng,Mary said that she had no regrets.
1953411,eng,You need to be here for your family.
69796,eng,Can you play the violin?
2361128,eng,I don't care about the risk.
3202260,eng,No one has ever told me that before.
248639,eng,We saw some old houses pulled down.
8013952,eng,We saw you coming out of the bar.
6547898,eng,Send me a postcard!
3918756,eng,I wonder why they chose her.
7152890,eng,We've all lived in Australia since we were born.
9807342,eng,Yanni left Algeria for good.
4663926,eng,Your outrage is completely justified.
8172582,eng,Tom said he hoped that Mary would be able to do that tomorrow.
3144541,eng,"It was only a suggestion, not an order."
9685019,eng,Could you translate this document to French?
8024115,eng,What's the highest mountain in Australia?
9166387,eng,I ran out of cheese.
8041917,eng,You write what I dictate.
7399941,eng,He said he plans to go Monday.
10165336,eng,Jugurtha was sent to serve militarily in Spain.
7174760,eng,Tom thought Mary and I went into the woods to kill ourselves.
6340281,eng,I wish I could do that as well as Tom does.
6107257,eng,Layla liked her high school.
8516432,eng,She leaned forward to look at him.
261778,eng,I bought my sister a new hat.
10130511,eng,He stopped working so he could study.
3333867,eng,It looks like you got it working.
1121345,eng,She's going up the rock.
7374938,eng,"Mary is still pretty young, isn't she?"
8409661,eng,Look at those arms and shoulders.
3635841,eng,I hope you change your mind.
7404372,eng,He knew that he was lost.
7505413,eng,Would you mind looking after my kids until I get back?
8175254,eng,The electron is an elementary particle.
8027176,eng,The racists should speak for themselves and not in the name of a whole region.
6264330,eng,This morning I saw Tom and Mary in the park.
10772753,eng,Down with capitalist slavery!
10023714,eng,Skura is Yanni's first girlfriend.
6652052,eng,Tom said that he wants to be a mechanic.
45795,eng,The teacher told us a funny story.
3726506,eng,You're not allowed to smile either.
8317049,eng,He left his umbrella at the office.
9199695,eng,The castle hotel's spacious grounds blend seamlessly with the fields and pastures of the surrounding countryside to form a paradise of relaxation far from the hustle and bustle of city life.
6694582,eng,Sami and Layla's confrontation turned violent.
316534,eng,She is no less slender than her sister is.
7379387,eng,Mary thinks she's a good person.
3729000,eng,"You can do this, I'm telling you."
5565088,eng,The party was pretty boring at first.

314499,eng,She seemed to be satisfied with the result of the exam.
6123575,eng,Tom didn't realize Mary was John's girlfriend.

431108,eng,But I don't know how to cook kebabs!
3446902,eng,Tom is asking how that's possible.

7993425,eng,Tom was contacted by Mary.

10641781,eng,"Tom was so shy that he didn't even look at Mary when he asked her in a thin, barely audible voice whether she might possibly consider going to the cinema with him."

7177078,eng,Tom said that nobody else tried doing that.

6268326,eng,Tom and I want to know more about Mary.
10250528,eng,My computer's acting up again.
3903681,eng,I'm with him now.
8480744,eng,He felt repulsed.
2663423,eng,That's not our only problem.
4538686,eng,My parents forbid me from seeing Tom again.

1677129,eng,Now the fact is official.
7271395,eng,Sami is part of the story.

10315009,eng,Thank you for your silence.

7095001,eng,"Writing paper, please!"

7171542,eng,I thought that you might like to know that.

3920751,eng,We could talk about them.
9447069,eng,Tom fired his gun as soon as he saw me.
6262440,eng,I'm helping as much as I can.
7519427,eng,I know Tom knows how we did that.
7231200,eng,I don't think that Tom is smarter than you.
8578870,eng,Cherif Omari is Algeria's minister of agriculture.
3166072,eng,Tom was the only one who seemed to notice.
9593742,eng,I don't like that guy. Stop going out with him.
2545815,eng,Tom finished his coffee.
2980028,eng,Men have unrealistic expectations about how women should look.
5933891,eng,"The words ""elitist"" and ""elitism"" are often used by anti-intellectuals."
411020,eng,"What I know about morals, I owe to soccer."
7853927,eng,"This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male-kind of you shall be circumcised. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you."
6334925,eng,Tom told me he plans to go.
2833874,eng,"I wanted to lock the door, but I'd lost the key."
7433378,eng,Why do they doubt themselves?
2703395,eng,Don't ever look at me again.
7736755,eng,Tom asked for Mary's address.
5756268,eng,When was the last time you went surfing?
10004716,eng,I showed Tom some pictures that I like.
7374235,eng,Mary's parents were disappointed that she couldn't get into Harvard.
8963857,eng,Why are there no forks on the table?
321524,eng,My predecessors had asked their questions of nature with genuine curiosity and awaited her reply.
6559405,eng,I'm not gonna take a no for an answer.
2293215,eng,I assume you found Tom.
6252158,eng,Tom didn't really have to do a thing.
315963,eng,She stared me down with anger.
6711223,eng,Sami attended a segregated school.
8562434,eng,This is a good outcome.
247476,eng,Our school is ten minutes' walk from here.
8024898,eng,Her Kabyle dress makes her look young.
7401076,eng,She said she wasn't a Canadian.
8969632,eng,"Indonesia’s Mount Sinabung erupted Monday, sending a huge cloud of volcanic ash and dust as high as five kilometers into the sky."
7473832,eng,They refused to tell us what they did.
1815762,eng,I'm not a hero.
9125193,eng,Yanni read the book aloud.
5102485,eng,"I'm tired, too."
1396238,eng,She's curious to find out who sent the flowers.
7377877,eng,Mary told me that she was wounded.
10648591,eng,Every tribe has a few intellectuals. Most people are less intelligent. The Bell Curve governs intelligence distribution in a population.
6123079,eng,I'm sorry I wasn't there today.
2706782,eng,The Crostolo torrent is full of nutrias.
5916637,eng,I'm almost ready to go.
6526244,eng,Tom returned the books that he borrowed from the library.
7114295,eng,I just confessed.
6414243,eng,Mary has enough money to buy whatever she wants.
6226053,eng,Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
7471267,eng,Tom and Mary have assured me they'll be there.
7138028,eng,Sami bought a private jet.
8541521,eng,He was pretty laid-back.
6657532,eng,I advised Tom to do that as soon as possible.
292509,eng,He was careless in handling his pistol.
7397902,eng,He is scared of his father.
8466232,eng,I'll bring you.
1102357,eng,I'm beginning to understand why Tom loves Boston.
6408666,eng,Mary said she had something important to do this afternoon.
7035255,eng,They say she will be our new Arabic teacher.
6420049,eng,"Mary said that she plays the flute, too."
6344653,eng,You don't have enough time to eat now.
3823173,eng,I'm sorry to be late.
7520626,eng,I knew Tom was a truck driver.
10106822,eng,The fans all hope the club changes the manager.
8811461,eng,I've been here three times this week.
10372140,eng,I prefer staying home when it's cold because I can stay warm and wear whatever I want.
7384825,eng,She didn't change her mind.
4132569,eng,Can you take Tom to the airport?
7414484,eng,Sami had no idea how right he would be.
6694726,eng,"Tom isn't just my brother. He's my best friend, too."
7383947,eng,He told me you agreed with him.
10131465,eng,She scares me.
5677547,eng,What pity is it that we can die but once to serve our country.
6353615,eng,Tom didn't seem to really enjoy talking with Mary.
2203678,eng,Who fell?
8424579,eng,My mother has worked for most of her life.
2451868,eng,He sent me his picture.
9854155,eng,"Please, don't forget to do the homework."
6416888,eng,Mary said that she enjoyed your party a lot.
3109419,eng,You have thirty minutes to make your decision.
1782654,eng,I trained with the special forces.
7438200,eng,They said that they weren't having much fun.
6089380,eng,"I must admit, your idea was way better than mine."
7160420,eng,Sami took my phone.
9954044,eng,People who abandon their pets are heartless!
3395920,eng,What do you say we work on this together?
5739559,eng,The mission is terminated.
2358703,eng,I have a feeling Tom will be late.
4495302,eng,This is no myth.
2283652,eng,You don't have to go.
10273670,eng,She's turning her back on me.
3023284,eng,Tom was wearing an ugly plaid jacket and a polka-dot tie.
9149914,eng,Yanni definitely has a love for Algeria.
6412777,eng,Mary said she doesn't even want to think about it.
6512852,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were really drunk.
7246098,eng,Sami and Layla were getting to know each other.
7287295,eng,Sami was in the middle of his meeting.
388846,eng,"As soon as the bell rang, the teacher came into the classroom."
364503,eng,He is the fastest runner in his class.
6108413,eng,The station is three kilometers away from here.
2641626,eng,Tom said he needed one of us there.
6503148,eng,I thought Tom and Mary were going to win the contest.
5193190,eng,I have a pen pal in Australia.
3241713,eng,"If you listen carefully to my instructions, it'll save you some time."
7471119,eng,Tom and Mary thought they could do that again.
4748884,eng,Does everyone get the plan?
6531919,eng,Tom is grinning at Mary.
819883,eng,She doesn't find anything better to do.
1094205,eng,Tom dropped in on Mary last night.
9865114,eng,My mother always told me not to eat too fast.
10337022,eng,"I'm a bit busy now, so go to the other room."
1092883,eng,Tom spent the whole day working on his French pronunciation.
6260201,eng,Tom wanted to do the right thing.
6490229,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that this week.
5757605,eng,I don't smoke weed.
2260572,eng,Is your wife tall?
257469,eng,I don't want to eat lunch now.
5852624,eng,I went downtown this afternoon.
9624240,eng,Tom must like doing it.
2360783,eng,I heard Tom was captured.
10316949,eng,"He did everything to be able to survive, hence he never wants to talk about it."
8088291,eng,The separatists have nothing to do with Kabyle values and integrity.
7736747,eng,Has Tom told you what has to be done?
7175829,eng,Tom thinks that Mary will be here soon.
10755596,eng,Everyone mourned his death.
7501095,eng,We're the only ones here who know Tom already knows why Mary had to do that.
6250835,eng,You can do that now if you want to.
6504433,eng,I can't believe that Tom and Mary are grandparents.
3428313,eng,Tom is aware of his own faults.
6355139,eng,I'll come again tomorrow.
3823094,eng,When do you have to leave?
3910185,eng,The guards didn't see us.
2497828,eng,We're trying to cut down expenses.
5850659,eng,I found my bike.
5474194,eng,Their son's name is Tom.
7179965,eng,Tom said that I was boring.
7267629,eng,Sami is reading the post.
3934295,eng,Teachers should encourage students to develop their problem solving skills.
6266567,eng,Tom is sure he has to do that.
45624,eng,The twins have come down with measles.
9192863,eng,"The more languages you speak, the more you're worth."
6265440,eng,"You took notes, didn't you?"
3387129,eng,"Do as I say, and not as I do."
3151464,eng,Give me the watch.
8159983,eng,Don't promise what you can't give.
6074226,eng,The maid was cleaning the room with the vacuum cleaner.
4665424,eng,Tom is going to be exhausted.
10181365,eng,"When I have to wait at the doctor's surgery, I usually while away the boredom with a good book."
4499083,eng,The ground is spongy.
9868509,eng,We're a lot bigger than you are.
1027848,eng,Tom urged Mary to drive carefully.
6261975,eng,Tom should tell Mary he won't be at her party.
3729937,eng,Tom cleared his throat nervously.
7294548,eng,Sami recognized the little girl that was in Layla's arm.
10784421,eng,Tom passed Mary in the hallway.
7381596,eng,Mary looks like she's well.
6527339,eng,Tom wanted to know the cause of the accident.
6356143,eng,Tom told me he was mad.
6494279,eng,Tom and Mary ate the chocolate chip cookies that John made for them.
2034073,eng,The last thing I want to do is leave you here alone.
9496262,eng,"When he doesn't respond to my messages, I feel as if I don't matter to him."
8155048,eng,Tom said that you wouldn't try.
10335036,eng,Something's the matter with this TV set.
7471769,eng,Tom and Mary thought their legs was broken.
323934,eng,The gate is open now.
10218181,eng,This won't be the last word on the subject.
8127327,eng,Mennad turned on the light.
5858311,eng,I'm full of hope.
8381191,eng,Tom is the one who told me to read this book.
3062143,eng,The torrential rain did quite a bit of damage.
269905,eng,Every man has his weak side.
10590370,eng,Thieves broke into my house and stole my jewelry.
4027758,eng,Dan started a fight with Matt.
6234604,eng,I think it would be dangerous for us to do that.
8604910,eng,The wilaya of Algiers is Algeria's most populous region.
1095229,eng,Tom confessed that he'd eaten all of the cookies.
7493698,eng,Tom is a day trader.
6697382,eng,Tom is a computer engineer.
9026387,eng,Tom wasn't John's best man.
9422032,eng,Ignore him completely.
6342616,eng,I wonder if we can take care of ourselves.
10534248,eng,Tom is out here somewhere.
3904062,eng,Do you have classes with him?
3313153,eng,We can walk back.
2276521,eng,It doesn't sound too bad.
16432,eng,You failed to wake Harry up.
3731102,eng,What if something happens to Tom?
6085813,eng,I wish that I could do that better.
7443578,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were really hungry.
2959131,eng,The records of our company show a large profit for the year.
9465229,eng,The first thing you have to do is contact Tom.
4131563,eng,How do you expect me to have children when I don't have a uterus?
7196696,eng,Tom glanced at his watch and was surprised it was already midnight.
2720175,eng,They are spinning wool.
6500086,eng,I don't understand why Tom and Mary aren't supposed to do that.
8391483,eng,She's the prettiest girl in the group.
6869700,eng,Tom should have been outside playing with the other children.
246701,eng,One third of the friends I grew up with are dead.
2891628,eng,It's one of mine.
1761961,eng,Saudi women are not permitted to leave their country without their husbands.
1229132,eng,The lake's water is as smooth as a mirror.
8175549,eng,He knows where his mother is.
6862528,eng,The dog never stops barking.
9638746,eng,"Tom, you need to come here tomorrow."
6347630,eng,Tom and I'll be traveling together.
1633890,eng,I have done everything I was supposed to do.
313128,eng,She is aggressive.
4027572,eng,I perform my work very well.
6489936,eng,Tom and Mary took their socks off.
9793591,eng,Yanni couldn't believe it.
7439480,eng,They said they'd be able to help us.
10214161,eng,Ziri never changes his sheets.
7991945,eng,Sami was struggling with his mental issues.
6440137,eng,When did Tom kiss Mary?
3784936,eng,There is no way to go there.
10751340,eng,Tom got stabbed in the back.
1028666,eng,Tom held Mary's hand.
10117698,eng,"I've been planning to post about politics, but gave up."
25890,eng,You'd better break off smoking.
311489,eng,She had never spoken to him before that time.
10121626,eng,"I feel anxious about letting Mary go just by herself, so would you go with her Tom."
7523557,eng,"The warming trend observed over the past century can only be explained by the effects that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, have had on the climate."
6222783,eng,Tom didn't want anybody to do that.
5619055,eng,Tom always carries a Bible.
8012790,eng,I can't understand how I can put it any simpler.
6353240,eng,I wonder what made Tom think Mary needed to do that?
3424210,eng,Tom takes a shower every day.
7403813,eng,She looked like she was hot.
2808577,eng,"After the survey, we will send in the results immediately."
6040084,eng,There's a very good chance that Tom will be late.
320988,eng,Did you see the show at Takarazuka?
3403163,eng,Tom did it willingly.
9204398,eng,There's loads of work in the office.
8456130,eng,Tom never pets his dog.
9052719,eng,Yanni is an Algerian long-distance truck driver.
6664441,eng,I don't want to live on my own.
2649009,eng,Is Tom your kid?
6242653,eng,Tom moved to Boston just three months ago.
7163726,eng,I used to love Australia.
10076125,eng,Yanni almost never speaks up for himself.
5853799,eng,Tom didn't believe his eyes.
6255361,eng,Tom did everything he could to keep Mary from doing that.
6705567,eng,I want you to take me seriously.
20254,eng,The train has not arrived yet.
238687,eng,Married people sometimes wish they were single.
9982317,eng,You can't see anything because of the fog.
3461109,eng,We only lack a few details to precisely reconstruct the crime scene.
7844597,eng,Don't throw rocks at my dog.
1783033,eng,What did you do with the Native Americans?
2376095,eng,I know my limitations.
3820333,eng,Let's play tennis.
6963953,eng,The two-state solution won't work.
8208809,eng,Don't do anything that I wouldn't do.
41370,eng,I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
6247156,eng,Tom is lucky to still be in Boston now.
8567796,eng,He grew up with his grandparents in Algeria.
7590311,eng,I moved here 3 years ago.
9722574,eng,How important is your family to you?
1768861,eng,He'll rip my head off.
7543601,eng,Tom seemed a little freaked out.
10288749,eng,Why don't we drive up there?
247917,eng,We enjoyed talking with each other.
5754651,eng,I've been in prison.
8895459,eng,Since then I've been looking for a job.
7410086,eng,They looked like they were satisfied.
10780990,eng,There are countless kinds of fanaticism.
3601860,eng,Are you going to be home for Christmas?
7471611,eng,Tom and Mary say they can't believe anybody.
7378183,eng,Mary looked just like her picture.
2125133,eng,We're so glad to have you here.
8222564,eng,Everybody looked out the window to see what was happening.
3123073,eng,Tom looked scared and worried.
4495283,eng,Tom was so calm.
5825337,eng,How far is it to the zoo?
7472428,eng,Tom and Mary say they don't like money.
5686218,eng,I think your sister will like this book.
6562338,eng,They didn't accept the gifts.
454492,eng,"Before, he would go to the firm on foot."
9075955,eng,Algeria is amazing. There is no other way to put it.
1230643,eng,You shouldn't trust people like this.
5725977,eng,Mistakes have obviously been made.
6242107,eng,I don't like anybody and nobody likes me.
1937693,eng,No one I know buys CDs anymore.
4499360,eng,I wanted to help.
302274,eng,He works every day except Sunday.
8374903,eng,I think Tom was impressed by what he saw.
268802,eng,There is an abundant supply of foodstuffs.
8224270,eng,Tom knew Mary had told everyone that she was going to do that.
5788097,eng,I'm going to vomit because of this club music.
1349620,eng,He's very likely to be late.
6810443,eng,I've just sold my car.
7539510,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has been getting ready to leave.
7437883,eng,Tom and Mary said that they liked it.
6660168,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as pessimistic as Mary seemed to be.
2898354,eng,Have you tasted such good soup before?
7870301,eng,What color are cucumbers?
464472,eng,Welcome to Columbia!
9970692,eng,None of our other problems are going to matter if the world becomes uninhabitable.
8054368,eng,Mennad was enjoying the pizza.
2858706,eng,He despises Tom.
306830,eng,They equate religion with church-going.
828619,eng,I hate ticks!
7731999,eng,Tom is younger than everyone else here.
7919783,eng,These two brothers are twins.
276484,eng,Give this ticket to whoever comes first.
6499218,eng,We're not going to leave Tom and Mary here by themselves.
10626127,eng,"I've always said it, the fault for everything was mine and mine alone."
5851925,eng,Tom was quite impressed by Mary.
278005,eng,Many trees died during the long drought.
6303472,eng,This is the best gift I've ever gotten!
4964253,eng,He gave his help to many.
10621838,eng,I gave him a lecture he won't forget.
6356069,eng,Tom wasn't a good cook.
3575321,eng,Tom's mother forced him to go outside even though he didn't want to.
6417582,eng,Mary started smoking when she was thirteen.
5685817,eng,We're being pulled over.
2826525,eng,Many people don't realize that antibiotics are ineffective against viral diseases.
10750286,eng,I haven't betrayed anyone.
8509500,eng,That wasn't the first time that I'd done that.
4360426,eng,Do you know in which country she lives now?
8528539,eng,"He's your twin brother, isn't he?"
1683889,eng,He's smart and beautiful.
7205194,eng,Sami rolled the window down.
10707219,eng,They play Russian roulette.
2534274,eng,What a waste of time!
41572,eng,Don't say that.
2686934,eng,We do it the way they demonstrated.
2492242,eng,I do not know where to start.
6511886,eng,I really thought Tom and Mary were hungry.
6256847,eng,I wish I could buy that for you.
6572307,eng,He hasn't been the same since you left him.
5216313,eng,I'm going to do it myself.
4962868,eng,I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
9442411,eng,We had a dry summer.
8692498,eng,I've heard you've had a hard time with transportation.
7733967,eng,It would probably be easy to do that by yourselves.
5620499,eng,We have to find out what's going on here.
2929514,eng,The meat is cooked to perfection.
5171689,eng,I've never done drugs.
2422575,eng,Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kids.
6252921,eng,Tom seems to be feeling discouraged.
3579583,eng,Bale needs to be more careful when playing because he’s already been given one yellow card.
9526499,eng,We're in a club.
3969984,eng,"At least, I think so."
6805856,eng,I forgot to put dressing on the salad.
9193082,eng,I've got a bad taste in my mouth.
6524076,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom knows Mary is coming with us.
6529406,eng,Tom needs to find a way to do that.
8009856,eng,Mennad and Baya were laughing at each other.
3396740,eng,Promise me you'll do that.
6431364,eng,Tom said Mary didn't want to eat Chinese food this evening.
4947784,eng,Oslo wants to make its center car-free within four years.
8069859,eng,You should've been doing the driving.
3209709,eng,The conference gives us an opportunity to see again specialists coming from around the world.
5137592,eng,"Unfortunately, that wasn't the case."
7186412,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't want to go to Australia with Mary.
2642871,eng,Tom seems slightly distracted.
3670744,eng,She's not as good as she thinks.
10771901,eng,The only person who knows it's Ziri's YouTube channel is Rima.
6663571,eng,Tom doesn't want to play tennis on Monday.
7380557,eng,Mary wouldn't do that herself.
3390693,eng,We don't say it that way around here.
3394331,eng,Are you positive that it was Tom?
6302318,eng,Sami wrote deep passionate e-mails to Layla.
3479819,eng,Tom poured milk into the cup.
6309896,eng,Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.
3902000,eng,It was Tom who discovered the crime scene.
10222545,eng,How dare you defy me?
8440543,eng,"If you're not better tomorrow, you should stay home from school."
10136670,eng,Algeria needs to encourage the use of proper irrigation techniques.
7268227,eng,Sami was walking back to his apartment building.
8511770,eng,It's perfect as it is.
3909104,eng,Take us downtown.
6354656,eng,I don't think Tom knows that Mary is Canadian.
17960,eng,I think it's wonderful that you're going on a picnic.
8922886,eng,The doctor has cured him.
6339212,eng,Tom told me he thought it would be OK to eat these berries.
6705977,eng,Sami knows that.
6418153,eng,I told Mary that I'd go to Boston with her.
7736955,eng,I can understand those comments.
7510313,eng,I didn't know that Tom knew who had to do that.
3181882,eng,"Let's just all go talk to Tom, OK?"
273390,eng,When the ship arrives in port it makes the people unsettled.
9462963,eng,When will big companies like Microsoft and Apple set up shops in Algeria?
6570054,eng,Sami's lawyer was using language that was very confusing for the jury.
7474887,eng,"They don't seem that busy, do they?"
71772,eng,It's at that counter.
6938676,eng,Where did you go this afternoon?
9737994,eng,Yanni lives in a lavish house.
3259154,eng,"I never have visited Sète, where Valéry wrote ""The Cemetery by the Sea""."
5462263,eng,Tom killed himself in Boston.
2474705,eng,It's easier for the rich to get richer.
314752,eng,She can make her own dresses.
9408763,eng,He bought a handful of chives.
7987396,eng,Sami got off his knees.
8403686,eng,He's forgetting a few details.
6342557,eng,Tom told me that he wouldn't do that again.
7213935,eng,Sami and Layla met each other in high school.
288088,eng,He is descended from a musical family.
3915706,eng,I don't want you to harass them.
6064247,eng,"If you don't do what the boss says, he'll fire you."
2791644,eng,I arrived home then I ate something.
9415797,eng,Did you go anywhere today?
10671308,eng,He walked at a slow pace toward the door.
3822908,eng,I'm not that lucky.
7235860,eng,I don't think that Tom has to do that right now.
6381216,eng,Come to the kitchen.
25615,eng,The prince bowed down to Snow White.
6700564,eng,Sami will never speak of this again.
9703563,eng,We won't see Tom around here anymore.
6440042,eng,Tom knew that I was mad.
7159231,eng,Tom is moving back to Australia.
5746675,eng,I welcome your thoughts.
6312049,eng,Sami and Layla were soon inseparable.
6732683,eng,They have more of them.
9847248,eng,Get rid of all this stuff.
406041,eng,I will give her the book tomorrow.
6157009,eng,Homer has taught all other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.
5736174,eng,I commend Tom for his bravery.
3906595,eng,Can I talk to them?
10027699,eng,"Are they Russian? ""Yes."""
6550386,eng,Purple is my favorite color.
8860613,eng,At what time should he ring?
4606056,eng,I am not a professional.
9804258,eng,Yanni is always busy.
281676,eng,Is there a Japanese-speaking stewardess?
6504278,eng,Tom and Mary don't have to sing if they don't want to.
9965712,eng,Why don't we tell Tom everything?
8466439,eng,Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
6647993,eng,Tom said that he wished that he hadn't spanked his son so hard.
2539942,eng,Tom won't be that hard to convince.
6018543,eng,This discussion is getting too political.
2544657,eng,I'm sure Tom is mad at me.
3596411,eng,"Pad See Ew is a Thai dish made with flat, broad rice noodles."
6106053,eng,Tom doesn't sound like a native French speaker.
1328324,eng,"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't."
8357787,eng,Tom seems very pleasant.
6220571,eng,Tom might want to do that.
7849984,eng,Maybe Tom likes someone else.
5351480,eng,What's in that box?
3395538,eng,Please don't make me do that again.
9183345,eng,Can anybody explain to me why this is happening?
9007377,eng,Everything's better without you.
8346397,eng,"Around the world, national leaders and diplomats have expressed their hopes that the United States will reverse its decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement on fighting climate change."
6519863,eng,Tom and Mary look like they're curious.
6873279,eng,I'm fond of skiing.
7472409,eng,Tom and Mary certainly enjoy their wine.
3920449,eng,They verbally abused me.
7748656,eng,I have to do three years of Berber.
6255730,eng,Tom said he was sick of doing that.
895080,eng,He is now working in France.
5687716,eng,Did you see the way he was looking at you?
6067755,eng,"I'd like to learn that language, but I have no practical reason to do so."
9975222,eng,I love my spouse.
6241793,eng,Just make sure you tell Tom to do that.
6940668,eng,Tom and Mary are likely to get seasick.
8297142,eng,I wish that there were a better translation of this book.
6107786,eng,Layla moved to the back seat.
238816,eng,Imagine yourself to be on the moon.
9062162,eng,I'll find a way to use them.
6228457,eng,"You've given up trying to convince Tom to do that, haven't you?"
6429330,eng,Mary broke her right arm.
10092304,eng,North Korea has weapons that date back to the disco era but they still are capable of killing thousands of South Korean and American troops.
3952213,eng,The forest was covered with snow and the evenings were quiet as animals slept through the cold winter nights.
6000111,eng,"The woman is crazy, that's what. She has a pug dog she calls Queenie and it has its meals at the table along with the family, eating off a china plate."
6342791,eng,Tom is probably still waiting in the lobby.
6945916,eng,I do swim almost every day.
4876091,eng,The show was interesting.
7409132,eng,"They already knew that, didn't they?"
3982089,eng,Which is more common?
5736650,eng,Let's all keep that in mind.
7748707,eng,I feel completely fluent in Berber.
9801063,eng,Yanni didn't even read the menu.
7220076,eng,Sami got a higher position within the department he was in.
328834,eng,If they can get both a forged card and its PIN then all the cash in the bank account will be withdrawn.
1178054,eng,What's the difference between an owl and a barn owl?
8871733,eng,I'd like to have lunch with you.
3522023,eng,I just need a minute alone with Tom.
7175474,eng,Tom thought that Mary would win.
1522079,eng,This sentence exemplifies the way in which the aforementioned expression has come to be completely divorced from its root.
8088262,eng,How dare you insult the Algerian flag?
309653,eng,Her smile convinced him that she was happy.
6983821,eng,He's always sad.
7873653,eng,We have everything we need for a barbecue.
317236,eng,She failed to keep her promise.
274266,eng,The minister had to resign.
8831825,eng,It's common knowledge.
1748952,eng,She is not as pretty as her sister.
7182765,eng,Tom said that he didn't believe that Mary did that.
8049618,eng,Mennad joined Baya.
6730775,eng,I'm not as good at doing that as Tom is.
3904989,eng,No one trusts you.
10110947,eng,Tom bought a treadmill.
5203895,eng,We got off to a pretty good start.
9146528,eng,"My parents are divorced, too."
5849595,eng,I like women who don't wear too much makeup.
7470586,eng,Tom and Mary say that they're prepared to do that.
7168969,eng,I think that Tom is the one who drew this picture.
6248332,eng,Tom spent a lot of time reading books.
9143143,eng,Yanni took off.
2450049,eng,This is altogether different.
6581101,eng,I asked Thomas if he had ever kissed a girl.
6496985,eng,Tom and Mary said they needed three hundred thousand dollars.
6899074,eng,"Tom is an athlete, isn't he?"
7379341,eng,Mary took her kids to Australia.
3394279,eng,"I'll get back to you, Tom."
6236850,eng,"You didn't know anything about this, did you?"
10083479,eng,This watermelon is about three times larger than that one.
9176983,eng,I paid and left.
7113391,eng,Tom went in the house.
9314386,eng,Every mosquito species makes a slightly different buzz.
3728240,eng,Tom was out of sight.
3313524,eng,He's not eating.
3093784,eng,I don't think Tom is responsible for that.
9495885,eng,Ask someone else.
2408149,eng,I think that would be best.
7235670,eng,I don't think that any of us will get rich doing this.
4663155,eng,Tom told me he was hoping to get into Harvard.
1028295,eng,Tom missed the opportunity to go to Boston with Mary.
322835,eng,Don't exert yourself.
3618415,eng,How far are you from here?
5930317,eng,I love Slavic languages.
6912991,eng,"Which are you better at cooking, Japanese food or Chinese food?"
8852768,eng,"Even if there were 30 million Palestinians, they should all have the right to return to Palestine."
5848866,eng,Tom and Mary sang background vocals.
5119623,eng,"The longer you let the tomato sauce simmer, the tastier it will be."
9015617,eng,Which competition did you use to train for?
3919162,eng,I'll buy her a new one.
6660858,eng,I'm the only one who knew the answer.
7189604,eng,Sami handed the bottle to Layla.
5731997,eng,The response time was amazing.
1687390,eng,I always felt like she was hiding something.
3559805,eng,Where would you like to go this afternoon?
1588672,eng,She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
8052685,eng,This is the bike Mennad usually used.
6331984,eng,There is a likelihood that we won't be attending the party.
2973708,eng,Tom might be able to help us.
3050127,eng,The car is brown.
7317281,eng,Sami sent Layla horrible videos about Islam.
9992120,eng,Yanni believed Skura immediately.
9466036,eng,"At a glance, Mr. Tanaka looks young, but they say he's actually rather old."
6264809,eng,I helped people off the bus.
3393020,eng,Did you feel that?
10585192,eng,I have a burden on my conscience.
5325844,eng,The pilot controls the engine power using the throttle.
2953107,eng,It's just a guess.
5769712,eng,Tom got busted.
6205855,eng,I fancy I know this feeling of relief.
7492895,eng,The car isn't illegally parked.
10607011,eng,The next city I'm going visit is Boston.
7194799,eng,Aren't you supposed to be in Australia?
6435661,eng,Tom is going to be in Boston all week.
6267021,eng,You're a very fussy eater.
10134169,eng,What's the average annual income of small farmers in Algeria?
6476397,eng,Now Sami knows.
7169390,eng,I think that Tom must be thirsty.
1700098,eng,That guy is an outlaw.
7111545,eng,I didn't think the pain would ever stop.
7117376,eng,Tom seemed to be possessed.
5506290,eng,Tom told me that I should go there by myself.
10765737,eng,Welcome aboard Air Algerie.
2994998,eng,Love belongs to those who think about it.
7403776,eng,He lost everything he had.
3726554,eng,I guess I should've asked you out to dinner.
7306881,eng,Sami separated himself from the negative people in his life.
2548254,eng,I'm going into town.
8054307,eng,Mennad has a nice bike.
8975238,eng,I appreciate what Tom did.
7991847,eng,Sami was in a difficult situation.
7521992,eng,I know Tom is weird.
316939,eng,She closely resembles her mother.
9447345,eng,"If you agree, sign here."
2288251,eng,"You were there, weren't you?"
5840359,eng,I saw the cat.
6769626,eng,One of my best friends is a Canadian.
6242901,eng,Tom has been accused of inciting violence.
7539973,eng,Tom picked up some beautiful shells on the beach.
8981789,eng,Mary is sleepy.
4494255,eng,The news was devastating.
3152746,eng,Are you giving me another chance?
7398208,eng,She told me she's doing that now.
7963285,eng,Sami left his backpack.
1951687,eng,I can't give those to you.
1800324,eng,The scene is always the same.
9978075,eng,Yanni can use this windshield repair kit multiple times.
7517205,eng,I know that Tom didn't do that again.
2172039,eng,Purchase any necessary articles quickly.
7171072,eng,I thought that you said that Tom was stupid.
258451,eng,I don't have any good reference book at hand.
8253023,eng,I heard you were crying.
7400335,eng,He did that as he'd been told.
1404248,eng,I don't think you can beat me.
5386210,eng,Thanks for coming. It means a lot to me.
5279763,eng,Tom is a really confident kid.
8517456,eng,Both Tom and Mary are thirteen.
6378642,eng,Sami fired and missed.
6230701,eng,How many more weeks will it take to finish doing that?
10097981,eng,I can't dye my hair. My mom would kill me!
2547656,eng,I've told the police.
422476,eng,You hit for 120 points!
10738329,eng,I can hear the wind blowing.
395395,eng,"When Fred hears loud music, he gets annoyed."
9868315,eng,Ew.
6249779,eng,Maybe Tom won't finish on time.
8481793,eng,He has a problem with drug abuse.
8473661,eng,Tom said that I was about to die.
3932954,eng,Dan called the police to report an emergency.
8255359,eng,We've already spent way too much time doing this.
4194529,eng,I'm not the trendy type.
7976442,eng,Sami is not a cop.
9133594,eng,Maria didn't want to be a doctor like her mother.
7197290,eng,It's not too late to tell Tom you love him.
6221436,eng,Tom had to have been annoyed.
4927775,eng,They were young and foolish.
2738421,eng,I like to cook.
2420399,eng,A sailor saw his friend drown from exhaustion.
5712595,eng,She looked angry.
4591721,eng,Who said cross stitch is strictly for women only?
2428491,eng,The following words are called pronouns and are used as the subject of a sentence. They represent a person or a thing.
279681,eng,The return on the investment will be high.
3913357,eng,You can't let him stay here.
682282,eng,Mary urged her parents to let her go out with her friends.
6201702,eng,"Meteorologists are people who know a tremendous amount about geophysics, thermodynamics and climatology, and almost nothing about tomorrow's weather."
967759,eng,All the old magazines are sold out.
1841593,eng,Nobody knows.
7232451,eng,I don't think that I'll be doing that this afternoon.
6534864,eng,I finally found a job.
10213400,eng,Rima is a woman.
6425146,eng,Mary told me she hasn't seen Tom.
6325474,eng,"Sami moved in with his older sister, Layla."
7190616,eng,Sami called the phone back.
8570242,eng,I'm eating my fourth strawberry.
5746673,eng,I won't be voting today.
10525008,eng,Why did Tom leave his suitcase here?
3476867,eng,Tom may have been injured.
7392816,eng,She said that she wasn't a terrorist.
909554,eng,Parents should spend quality time with their children.
8517207,eng,He likes to observe the people walking by.
6124223,eng,"Tom sat in the car, looking at people walking by."
6276642,eng,I want to go and get a haircut.
9770428,eng,Many people emigrated to America.
2013972,eng,I want you to understand this.
6420575,eng,Did Mary say she didn't need to do that?
2044455,eng,Tom is always happy.
9233805,eng,I have plenty of free time.
8868991,eng,You can't leave us here by ourselves.
2013526,eng,I don't want to leave Boston.
6662554,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so spontaneous.
8406014,eng,I can take a taxi if I have to.
6341365,eng,What makes you think Tom didn't do that?
6310295,eng,You need a specialized tool in order to fix this.
5938138,eng,You're much taller than Tom.
6426699,eng,Mary knew that she could do it.
3330376,eng,I found this on the floor in the kitchen.
8180284,eng,I think Tom and I overdid it a little last night.
6168165,eng,See what you've done!
3181144,eng,Just go talk to Tom.
8913606,eng,Give me a topic.
6353102,eng,I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is happy or not.
3730929,eng,What do you say we go for a swim?
9368860,eng,The gig was fantastic from start to end.
73700,eng,Performed is the right word.
9761729,eng,Do you think it's trustworthy?
6513562,eng,Tom and Mary swore that they'd never do that.
7481207,eng,I'm old now.
2361456,eng,I don't think that's going to work.
10724823,eng,Everyone in the village knows the doctor.
8402993,eng,I've been working as hard as I can.
6251198,eng,I've had no chance to visit Boston.
7265068,eng,I couldn't keep my mind off of Mary.
8049780,eng,Mennad hates weddings.
2415752,eng,A moon is already shining.
6502975,eng,Tom and Mary didn't tell John why they didn't like him.
8785502,eng,"The chimp's eyes narrowed, ready to hurtle the stone at the slightest provocation."
9440464,eng,Is Algeria's economy facing a cash shortage?
2102608,eng,Are you familiar with the new song yet?
7864331,eng,Is oil a curse for Algeria?
2613709,eng,Tom told me that he and Mary spent their summer vacation at the beach.
9301685,eng,Would it be OK if I took your picture?
10515751,eng,I sent some Spanish exercises to your email.
7377966,eng,Mary should've let me talk to her.
422953,eng,"We have pilaf, lo mein, and kebabs in our restaurant."
3223123,eng,Tom was sitting in my favorite chair.
5245396,eng,I was trying to lose weight.
7130266,eng,Tom and Mary are just about finished here.
6376663,eng,Good things should be savored.
3260124,eng,"I am not going to the picnic, because I don't feel well."
2546622,eng,I'm getting rid of Tom.
10460772,eng,Warsaw is beautiful at this time of year.
10574167,eng,I wonder why Tom refused to help Mary do that?
7378198,eng,Mary knows that she can trust you.
2548849,eng,I want you to lose.
8160921,eng,"After reading it, you have to sign it."
2239760,eng,Tom was cool.
8557583,eng,You can ask Tom yourself tomorrow when you see him.
6354653,eng,I don't think Tom knows what Mary needs to do.
7150000,eng,Why did Tom not want to go to Australia?
2992912,eng,An artist is capable of capturing the atmosphere of the place with just a few lines.
6717868,eng,Sami promised to return with more help.
7219886,eng,Sami adored the social media department where he worked.
10134128,eng,Algeria is an independent African country.
836951,eng,I haven't seen him this morning. Maybe he's already left for the meeting.
7191917,eng,I knew Tom was in Australia.
423088,eng,Are you an Uighur?
6656792,eng,"Tom wasn't truthful, but Mary was."
2854446,eng,I went up the stairs and went to bed.
2028370,eng,I just don't want to discuss it right now.
3819550,eng,Thank you very much for today.
3635944,eng,I think it would be best if you didn't go over to Tom's house.
10736016,eng,There are many old people in this village.
274820,eng,"The more skills one masters, the greater contribution one can make to society."
2167427,eng,Today I have to study.
10201613,eng,"Congratulations on becoming a grandfather, Tom!"
6337361,eng,I wonder if Tom really can take care of himself.
3723473,eng,I just don't feel it's appropriate.
5849289,eng,I don't think I'll sing that song tonight.
2644434,eng,Tom drives Mary to school.
1214023,eng,What would you do if this was your last day?
8257065,eng,His house and ours were across from each other.
7375406,eng,Mary said that she was ready to help.
6272539,eng,Tom thinks Mary won't kiss John.
8177863,eng,Tom decided he wanted to live in Boston.
3223116,eng,Tom sat on the bench all by himself.
6114468,eng,The only problem was that Sami was married.
2007760,eng,Let's get it inside.
6269716,eng,Tom always seems to be sick.
1886325,eng,Are you really a nun?
296629,eng,He will be here all evening.
5848481,eng,Tom always does the right thing.
2236145,eng,Tom came yesterday.
3737858,eng,How about getting me another glass of wine?
1093788,eng,Tom had to do everything himself.
7213753,eng,Sami only kept the job for a few months.
9997001,eng,She put her coat on and went.
295029,eng,He showed courage in the face of danger.
7514635,eng,I know that Tom is a very selfish person.
2147345,eng,Thank you for the last invitation.
8453894,eng,My dad used to work at the Home Office.
6229189,eng,"Tom could've been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't."
2245421,eng,Everybody looked nervous.
8887078,eng,I received a text from Tom saying he'd be late.
3099014,eng,Tom has enough on his mind without worrying about me.
8818101,eng,The area where Yanni and Skura had a picnic overlooked his home.
9227262,eng,Tom did it correctly.
10038809,eng,Trust your heart!
1242859,eng,There's no need for you to study.
8248963,eng,Read that verse again.
4777059,eng,This restaurant has pulao.
7129913,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as indecisive as Mary seemed to be.
8382221,eng,Mary is making herself a dress.
1635514,eng,They were three and they were all armed.
2544602,eng,Tom didn't have much time.
5435626,eng,We had to do it again.
1886068,eng,Do you promise me you'll do that?
6355780,eng,Tom allowed Mary to cry herself to sleep.
5742783,eng,Tom pulled a knife on Mary.
5215394,eng,"Regardless of race, religion, faith or sexual orientation, we’re all Americans, and we need to be looking after each other and protecting each other at all times in the face of this kind of terrible act."
1062562,eng,I wanted to ask Mary out but I chickened out at the last moment.
8684611,eng,I was making a snowman.
419268,eng,Nobody ever got rich by saving on drinks.
3312196,eng,We'll gladly take you home.
2844094,eng,She is lazy.
21916,eng,Mastering a foreign language involves a lot of patience.
5642797,eng,Tom explained why he was there.
329397,eng,"Risk money refers to funds placed in investments that seek high-return, although high-risk, investments."
6262777,eng,I know you understand French.
5587743,eng,Jupiter is two and a half times as heavy as all the other planets in the Solar System put together.
7202917,eng,Sami lived down the street from us.
2243235,eng,They look tired.
7394131,eng,She says she's going to beat you up.
8397861,eng,"I'm talented, I think."
6781617,eng,I smiled at everyone.
7169143,eng,I think that Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
6648652,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary was at home.
10654868,eng,The cafe nearest the school is closed at lunchtime.
7724992,eng,"The months of the year are: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December."
10504370,eng,Do you like my language?
7503547,eng,I know Tom knows that Mary doesn't have to do that anymore.
308683,eng,She could not make both ends meet on her income.
2956117,eng,Tom began to work for our company three years ago.
9650554,eng,I tried to help everyone I could.
8385638,eng,Mary had twins.
7737834,eng,I had three exams today.
9255855,eng,Where did she learn German?
7500913,eng,"I know Tom says that he's a fashion designer, but I don't think that he really is."
6445826,eng,Sami continued praying.
4715891,eng,Tom has decided to have the surgery.
318238,eng,I'll never fail to meet your expectations.
7134565,eng,No doubt Tom will enjoy doing that.
898550,eng,My vet told me to feed my dog in the evening.
5319754,eng,Things are not black and white.
6233499,eng,I should go with Tom.
7824293,eng,Tom is our oldest child.
9505066,eng,The pilot won't arrive late.
8564682,eng,Do you think Tom will be found guilty?
2669324,eng,"Give me those socks, my feet are getting cold."
8182106,eng,I think it's unlikely Tom will get back in time for supper.
10659708,eng,Tom ate the last cookie.
6870917,eng,I would have shown you how to do it right.
5645334,eng,The judge started to read the sentence.
5641552,eng,I've never seen anybody die.
8002383,eng,Tom is almost ready to start.
9190016,eng,The reason he won the election is because a lot of people found him relatable.
9667814,eng,Do you really want to shut it down?
2250329,eng,Give me a beer.
3329956,eng,I wish Tom were here with us.
5853234,eng,I stayed cool.
70535,eng,I am willing to take your offer.
2214286,eng,I'm scared to talk to her.
3097226,eng,"First of all, we have to plant all these seeds."
2720087,eng,He is shearing the sheep.
1463,eng,I don't speak French well enough!
6424468,eng,Mary told me she was feeling fine.
881618,eng,We were talking about you that day.
6242666,eng,"You promised to do that, but you didn't."
8097773,eng,Who does not like playing football?
7843479,eng,Layla lives in Damascus.
7520540,eng,I know Tom will do that again.
6692541,eng,There doesn't seem to be anybody inside.
327693,eng,"The first 'that time of the month' I seem to remember worrying that I was ill, without telling anybody, for two days."
6470126,eng,Why are you singing here?
6375761,eng,Sami is a divorce attorney.
6561160,eng,"Welcome to our guest from Egypt, Sami Bakir."
8380835,eng,Tom was the one that taught me how to ski.
8823736,eng,Does Tom like comic books?
2145988,eng,My grandmother cooked for five.
8784104,eng,Yanni got caught by a game warden.
5483235,eng,Can I copy your notes?
2738193,eng,The police arrested Tom this afternoon.
7989828,eng,Sami was sitting in the living room.
7158566,eng,Being second is to be the first of the ones who lose.
8341175,eng,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
9671782,eng,He has an impetuous and irascible personality.
7385606,eng,She might do that on her own.
6263231,eng,I didn't plan to go anywhere.
7402766,eng,She says she'd rather not go.
3422240,eng,It's all been changed.
311649,eng,She is good at playing tennis.
4025587,eng,He one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of his opponent.
8653887,eng,"It's very common in Asia, especially amongst young people."
7404081,eng,He says he isn't worried.
6257029,eng,Tom died in 2013 of natural causes.
7731487,eng,Tom is going to graduate from high school this year.
699996,eng,One of the greatest chapters in the history of western music came to a close with the death of Beethoven.
10172814,eng,He's going to have lunch at a cafeteria.
3608123,eng,Do you spend a lot of time with your friends?
4494243,eng,There's an easy solution.
754838,eng,Khaki shorts with cargo pockets do not make you an adventurer.
9982097,eng,Can I smoke here?
7394595,eng,She said she wanted to study abroad.
7518789,eng,I know you won't enjoy doing that.
8910504,eng,We never talked to Tom.
7208162,eng,I just hope we keep winning.
10030772,eng,Yanni was about Skura's age.
9704060,eng,I urgently need to speak to Tom.
10434537,eng,"As far as I know, Tom is a nice guy."
8622535,eng,"Every day, he asks her the same question."
6709737,eng,Sami survived a barrage of bullets.
8716832,eng,"He always feels he doesn't have enough time, but he doesn't have any idea where his time goes."
2955693,eng,Tom and Mary already know each other.
3315106,eng,It's a big deal to me.
3920977,eng,I know everything about her.
7519104,eng,I didn't see anybody I recognized.
5391316,eng,Did you watch the Olympics closing ceremony?
3737197,eng,Tom seemed interested in what we had to say.
7637208,eng,What's the difference between boiling and simmering?
286217,eng,His way of thinking is very childish.
6665339,eng,I don't love my wife anymore.
1871817,eng,He seemed very surprised when I told him about it.
6952975,eng,"In this forest, humans and squirrels still live together in harmony."
6515560,eng,Tom and Mary told us they wouldn't do that.
1028456,eng,Tom isn't as young as Mary.
8371625,eng,Tom is feeling a little guilty.
39418,eng,I have tennis elbow.
10068220,eng,Who's the most famous person you've ever spoken to?
2564691,eng,You have crossed a line.
7191888,eng,I know that Tom has a house in Australia.
61162,eng,Let's try this cake.
7387122,eng,She can't get her car to start.
316046,eng,She went inside.
6663893,eng,Tom still goes jogging every morning.
6243111,eng,"Tom didn't really need to do that, did he?"
5997631,eng,She plays piano by ear.
1216287,eng,"If I'm rich, I'll give you money."
8057521,eng,Mennad had a nose job at 16.
8528142,eng,"She's done for today, isn't she?"
2954408,eng,You can drink whatever you want.
48120,eng,The lake is notorious for its contamination.
3477793,eng,Tom pretended to be hard of hearing.
7286750,eng,Sami was losing his fucking shit.
6511998,eng,I heard that Tom and Mary have been fired.
8859748,eng,I'd probably be forgiven if I did that.
6789829,eng,"A grove stood in the city, rich in shade, / where storm-tost Tyrians, past the perilous brine, / dug from the ground, by royal Juno's aid, / a war-steed's head, to far-off days a sign / that wealth and prowess should adorn the line."
3181772,eng,Tom never talks about his work.
2245533,eng,Hang on everybody.
2956430,eng,Tom did everything he could for Mary.
6900136,eng,One cannot translate sentences literally.
4979899,eng,Ken did that.
8525529,eng,She knows why he quit his job.
6657638,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so romantic.
266699,eng,It took me three hours to finish my homework.
10011409,eng,Yanni works on his own car.
9515746,eng,You have failed again.
7395372,eng,She told me that she was uninsured.
6230911,eng,Tom would be healthier if he didn't eat so much junk food.
3910274,eng,I'll see him next week.
50848,eng,Then I'll help you overturn the wagon.
8566721,eng,She told his friends that he never ate meat.
9725932,eng,Yanni was so horrible.
7211898,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary was witty.
6334683,eng,We couldn't have done that without your help.
8789086,eng,Yanni went to the Islamic center.
7177674,eng,Tom said that Mary was fascinated by that.
414449,eng,To turn a disaster into an opportunity.
6126332,eng,Tom couldn't believe his bad luck.
1633163,eng,Which is the book we're talking about?
852596,eng,See you tomorrow at the office.
6321061,eng,How dare you do this to me again?
1653521,eng,We can't wait for the weekend.
8480706,eng,He does like her.
6476400,eng,Why is life so horrible?
4499402,eng,I hope Tom will be on time.
7797437,eng,My house is by the sea.
8180316,eng,I think that I could be persuaded to do that.
10204430,eng,Ziri never uses this room.
7783854,eng,Does anybody here have an umbrella that I can borrow?
262028,eng,I felt sad for no reason.
10335945,eng,I walked the dog for Tom.
57943,eng,Houses can't be built in this area.
8182235,eng,I can't believe that you're going to give away all your money.
8792261,eng,He missed Skura.
1092279,eng,Tom will be here only a few days.
9197121,eng,"Don't look, there!"
10493749,eng,Don't put that in your mouth.
3907226,eng,Let's offer it to her.
7161282,eng,Sami asked Layla to wait outside.
66401,eng,Please tell me when you are coming back.
6796790,eng,When will Tom and Mary arrive?
9770802,eng,Yanni wanted Skura out of the marriage.
3735143,eng,Tom wants to move out and find a place of his own.
264807,eng,The subject is out of his sphere.
10123773,eng,You hold onto friends by keeping your heart a little softer than your head.
4012773,eng,How long has Tom been standing there?
2111809,eng,I apologized.
8479438,eng,He probably won.
10733932,eng,The company claims the delay was unintentional.
7734848,eng,"Tom is a really good golfer, isn't he?"
3737905,eng,Do you know anybody here?
6269128,eng,Tom is too drunk to do that.
9797720,eng,I'm very full.
6433604,eng,Tom said he wouldn't do anything about that.
2912619,eng,How much money did you bring with you?
7393910,eng,She told me that she studied French.
7147256,eng,Sami expressed his fear to the psychiatrist.
6659921,eng,Mary is both beautiful and intelligent.
8514423,eng,He lives three miles from her.
3914523,eng,I wanted to hurt her.
8532208,eng,She doesn't really enjoy singing with him.
6509945,eng,Tom and Mary claim that they've never lied to me.
8390719,eng,Go back to Algeria.
4498425,eng,Something unexpected happened.
9161971,eng,The lamp is on.
2958065,eng,Tom scratched his name off the list.
712882,eng,I wouldn't rule out the possibility of moving to another country if I get a good job offer.
286817,eng,When I saw his new hairstyle I tried hard to suppress my laughter.
8227135,eng,Don't skateboard here.
6655871,eng,Tom is a race car driver.
7245458,eng,Sami kept doing it.
5201090,eng,There are people who think pineapples grow underground.
54868,eng,It's true.
302540,eng,He supplied food and money to them.
717330,eng,"In the United States, fluoride is added to the drinking water."
5129533,eng,Even the moon was jealous of her beauty.
6378120,eng,Tonight you're gonna see why I despise that woman.
8099509,eng,Tom still sings.
8479396,eng,He never forgot.
8672212,eng,I'm not in the mood for fruit.
8614495,eng,He was really fast.
1563565,eng,Brazil became the sixth largest economy in the world.
378543,eng,I want to go to Kyoto.
3259927,eng,On what platform does the train from Lyon arrive?
2026351,eng,Do you want to go get something to eat?
5883000,eng,Everybody was afraid that something bad was gonna happen.
6496559,eng,Tom and Mary don't know where they're going to live next year.
7990107,eng,Sami was still in Cairo.
6260132,eng,Tom will be fined for doing that.
8961327,eng,Do you want one of these?
1030156,eng,"Before Mary got married, she was much thinner."
3403399,eng,What we have to do is persuade Tom to help us.
10297041,eng,Ziri can join Rima's channel.
884335,eng,Father was trying to correct his mistake.
6437676,eng,Tom thought Mary would help him.
2876947,eng,She injured a co-worker.
6236405,eng,I don't have enough time to do that right now.
797193,eng,The construction straddled two centuries.
6176929,eng,The son of a sibling is a nephew.
10081494,eng,I have three tests tomorrow.
7698546,eng,Is there anyone here who's not busy right now?
7998470,eng,Mennad worked at Walmart.
8175848,eng,He will call you.
2632236,eng,The door is at the end of the corridor.
10565581,eng,Mix the flour with the sugar.
9216938,eng,That house is haunted by Tom's ghost.
10216844,eng,Ziri can cook for Rima.
3903911,eng,I can't be friends with you.
3541800,eng,Tom was smart about the way he planned everything out.
52989,eng,"Excuse me, Joe, can I use your phone?"
3434107,eng,Tom has very short hair.
9085190,eng,The soldier stabbed Yanni's mother with a pitchfork.
9229677,eng,Tom woke up in pain.
3728742,eng,Go to yellow alert.
1656437,eng,Who is the fifteenth?
55278,eng,Whose are these pens?
8637452,eng,Your performance was sloppy.
7389844,eng,She locked her dog in the bathroom.
10123870,eng,That doesn't make you even a little bit uncomfortable?
7403333,eng,She told me she's skeptical.
7184279,eng,I didn't say I was going to Australia.
43340,eng,The old man is blind in one eye.
29043,eng,I took it that you would come.
10231840,eng,"Hi, I'm Ziri. You must be Rima."
265076,eng,"Actually, I didn't know anything about those plans."
9323412,eng,I left them a long message in Esperanto.
8679897,eng,He got sick during dinner.
10302001,eng,I should've studied harder before the term exams.
3919554,eng,We're avoiding her.
6524760,eng,"Everyone else does it, too."
2700805,eng,You're no longer part of my life.
1271071,eng,I'll explore the seven seas in a giant bucket.
8355299,eng,I think that I'm not bad-looking.
2240374,eng,She needs to be the center of attention all the time.
7160873,eng,Sami's kitten was meowing.
5756767,eng,We have a solid team.
7713402,eng,That's surely nonsense.
6492446,eng,Tom and Mary said that they wanted to move to Boston because that's where John lives.
6271763,eng,Tom will likely be tired.
7407368,eng,They looked at their cards.
3913700,eng,Why don't you leave them?
8855910,eng,The dull lecture bored the audience.
9189051,eng,"How do I know when to use ""in"", ""on"", or ""at"" when talking about time?"
6511778,eng,I thought Tom and Mary were carrying guns.
6344486,eng,Tom wasn't the one who gave this to me.
8353416,eng,I think that they knew something.
3297641,eng,I wanna go to New York.
2635928,eng,You're really not Tom?
9008740,eng,That doesn't mean there's no risk.
7130496,eng,Tom broke off his engagement with Mary.
2549101,eng,I'll help you out.
6097332,eng,Sami was living in a neighborhood where there was a lot of crime.
9011474,eng,Mary's eyes widened with horror.
6576511,eng,Everyone has gone crazy.
8336685,eng,It's a difficult time for us.
5110649,eng,Tom was murdered in 2013.
7258411,eng,Sami got in an Uber.
7175464,eng,Tom thought that Mary would likely win.
6244772,eng,Tom would never have done that that way.
7445063,eng,They told me why they didn't win.
8379159,eng,She's a pretty famous actress in Algeria.
7189859,eng,Sami was still dreaming.
6063215,eng,"In the lab, two graduate students were waiting for me."
3922976,eng,Tom really hates Mary.
10023289,eng,Yanni fired Skura yesterday.
8147155,eng,I don't even know what Berber means.
9230413,eng,I have no plans for Monday.
3620431,eng,Do Tom and Mary know each other?
5230616,eng,I know all about what has happened.
4915805,eng,I really had a good time.
2542181,eng,Tom was making a lot of noise.
887009,eng,She bought him a camera that was too big to fit in his shirt pocket.
635678,eng,I'm really too drunk for this now.
1026059,eng,Tom doesn't know who to turn to.
6767390,eng,Tom doesn't think he'll cry.
7992278,eng,Sami wanted to pursue a modeling career.
305993,eng,They bargained additional rations of bread and milk.
6412270,eng,Mary drank a lot of coffee so she could stay awake.
8381199,eng,Tom is absolutely certain Mary is in Boston.
50112,eng,The news broke her heart.
6550359,eng,That was the last picture Sami took.
1929633,eng,That's annoying.
4013971,eng,What else are you working on?
7542864,eng,Tom pretended he enjoyed doing that.
10221928,eng,Ziri wants to show Rima something.
8213182,eng,I know what I agreed to do.
3037820,eng,I just want to make you happy.
303593,eng,He studied day and night with a view to becoming a lawyer.
6340270,eng,It would be fun to go mountain climbing with you.
3416836,eng,"Tom is really talented, isn't he?"
3865007,eng,They agree with him.
6691377,eng,Tom had no girlfriend and no date.
6049314,eng,Tom is in the next room.
2007759,eng,Let's get some food.
6412425,eng,I don't think Mary knows how much time she'll need.
280584,eng,"After you have read it, give the book back to me."
58108,eng,Something is wrong with this washing machine.
7512161,eng,Tom already knows that we're best friends.
6666069,eng,Tom is the boss right now.
1342868,eng,Don't call her now.
4118883,eng,I was dumbfounded.
2245908,eng,I heard coughing.
7184148,eng,I doubt that the veracity of his statement.
9354991,eng,Mary has never had a boyfriend.
32344,eng,Mariko speaks English excellently.
8795433,eng,She survived the accident.
5937970,eng,Stop blaming everything on Tom.
8245996,eng,My parents would like to meet you.
8095335,eng,Tom is an ignorant wanker.
6434569,eng,Tom said he thought Mary would be scared.
6437728,eng,Tom said that he was going bald.
6127761,eng,You're not being straight with us.
1725092,eng,Have you ever sneezed in a meeting?
478481,eng,"I'd explain it to you, but your brain would explode."
8705925,eng,A Finnish bakery in Helsinki is creating cakes made in the shape of toilet paper rolls.
7356796,eng,Tom told Mary he had a headache even though he didn't really have one.
6048340,eng,Tom is the owner of the largest ranch in these parts.
7511624,eng,I know that I should've been more aggressive.
6526389,eng,I didn't know that Tom and Mary were seeing each other.
6658691,eng,Tom shouldn't go outside today.
6244293,eng,I don't think I'm as creative as Tom.
1796632,eng,Nobody talked about my country.
7437737,eng,Tom and Mary said they're annoyed.
5268637,eng,Tom promised to tell the truth.
8840338,eng,I think that I'm unlucky.
3358932,eng,You should visit more often.
9799588,eng,"That has to be taken into account, too."
9423422,eng,Tom went out for a walk with his kids.
8390317,eng,Platypuses are very shy animals.
6415882,eng,What time did Mary say she wanted to do that?
6869448,eng,You really should have been a little more polite.
9015806,eng,We spent a lot of money.
1342234,eng,Where can you buy books?
10132187,eng,The separatists want to destroy Algeria.
10206962,eng,Ziri asked a question.
3727977,eng,I saw to that.
8858675,eng,"Sometimes, it's in the questions, when they're well-formed, that the answers are found."
6229865,eng,"You knew that Tom didn't need to do that, didn't you?"
3636194,eng,It was your own fault.
7213065,eng,I can't let you in here.
2300663,eng,I can do it with one hand.
2206672,eng,Are you scared of me?
5095012,eng,I wish they were telling the truth; I too should have a share in that blessing.
8314197,eng,How do you make this verb negative in Berber?
6309919,eng,"Either his whole theory is incorrect, I thought to myself, ""or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery."""
2018855,eng,They don't want to do it themselves.
8514111,eng,She only has eyes for him.
2931681,eng,I found this in the cavern.
6125977,eng,Tom will have to do that by himself.
10791425,eng,How many loaves of bread do you usually buy?
3826275,eng,Have you ever noticed this before?
6228242,eng,"You weren't surprised that I wasn't able to do that, were you?"
7931495,eng,You're fishers.
9807000,eng,Yanni would go out and wouldn't come back for days.
10327779,eng,When was the last time you went to a movie theater?
2712861,eng,We'll start whenever you're ready.
7167551,eng,I know you used to live in Australia.
8017757,eng,Mennad was supportive to Baya.
7985662,eng,Sami listened to the conversation.
7521939,eng,I knew Tom was a cook.
3598116,eng,I saw my neighbor's dog running in my garden.
7400956,eng,She said that she had to split.
255619,eng,I've had only a couple of drinks.
6253497,eng,Tom should've asked Mary where she wanted him to park the car.
6509612,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't know all the rules.
9812452,eng,"The less time you spend here, the better."
10360238,eng,"You ripped this report from somewhere, didn't you? It's already up."
7141042,eng,Sami did his math exercises.
3497391,eng,Buy this and that. Do this and do that. So this is what being a man and getting the woman of your life is.
6029677,eng,I haven't seen Tom since Monday.
6243687,eng,Tom says he hopes that you don't do that.
502669,eng,I met an ear nose and throat doctor at a party on Sunday.
10215913,eng,Ziri ate the sauce.
2952930,eng,"If I had wanted your help, I would have asked for it."
4002590,eng,You know that woman is not just Caucasian.
6094462,eng,Aren't you a teacher here?
5807154,eng,I don't worry about those things.
6516277,eng,I certainly hope Tom and Mary do that.
1661191,eng,Tom is trying to understand.
4853281,eng,Tom didn't see anyone else at the station.
6108563,eng,I don't remember anything from that night.
7246576,eng,Sami doesn't understand anything Layla was going through.
10708065,eng,Night came.
2674732,eng,I don't take any medicine.
3991309,eng,Dan left his car abandoned on the Interstate.
7380116,eng,Mary said that she isn't happy.
9180410,eng,I still don't know a lot.
568363,eng,I read a most interesting novel yesterday.
6491483,eng,I wonder whether Tom and Mary are strong enough to do that.
10502355,eng,I'm waiting for you at the entrance.
6414474,eng,"Mary will ask Tom to do that for us, won't she?"
7434431,eng,I have dark eyes.
7131277,eng,Do you really want to do that all that much?
9783752,eng,That's strongly discouraged.
6427078,eng,Mary said she's ready to help.
1970139,eng,I was hoping we could still be friends.
9110479,eng,What time does the sun go down?
1242054,eng,The Russian Soyuz spacecraft has docked at the International Space Station.
7172817,eng,I thought that Tom was going to ask us to do that.
6764350,eng,"To say that that which is, is not or that which is not is, is a falsehood; and to say that which is, is and that which is not is not, is true."
6250125,eng,Tom and I played tennis all afternoon.
10538244,eng,I've made up my mind to become a journalist.
8407510,eng,French is interesting.
7511936,eng,I didn't know Tom didn't want me to help him.
6511357,eng,Were Tom and Mary not supposed to do that?
302337,eng,"Since he is old, this task must be difficult for him."
1961706,eng,I thought you two were the same age.
6516207,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are skinny.
6654918,eng,Tom said that he didn't have to go to Boston next week.
3433750,eng,The river Ganges is considered sacred to Hindus.
267901,eng,Would you please wait for a minute?
10263952,eng,The plates and cups are porcelain.
9866542,eng,Tom is an avid rock climber.
9200533,eng,We protest because we can't stand it anymore!
1912054,eng,She's already married.
8198320,eng,A Muslim man can marry a Christian or Jewish woman.
2488828,eng,This circle was drawn by a compass.
2260416,eng,"Did you kiss him? ""Yes, I kissed him."""
7178619,eng,Tom said Mary knew that he might be required to do that.
9440426,eng,Algeria has a social-style economy.
7541139,eng,Tom was the first person to start laughing.
9795617,eng,"I'd like some noodles with scrambled eggs, please."
5738552,eng,We're in a tough position.
5019721,eng,Tom works part-time.
5742055,eng,Tom should be at the beach.
6912600,eng,"Tom is almost thirty, isn't he?"
4846723,eng,Shouldn't we offer to help?
10028673,eng,I need help translating this.
3958102,eng,Dan didn't fulfill his duty.
8590928,eng,That was the last time Tom was seen.
3598170,eng,Don't forget your costume.
8049712,eng,Mennad broke Baya's porcelain collection.
6652843,eng,Tom said he thought that he might need to do that today.
5756714,eng,Tom texted a friend.
3670533,eng,I'm delighted that it's all over.
10073737,eng,Would you like it if Tom bossed you around?
320870,eng,Mother laid the table for dinner.
7154971,eng,Tom said he won't visit Australia.
3726721,eng,I suppose an explanation is called for.
6650331,eng,Tom said that he didn't know that Mary wasn't able to swim.
2361069,eng,I just can't get used to this.
8360428,eng,Was it easy for you to find a job?
2239884,eng,Tom wasn't concentrating.
9795723,eng,Tom was driving Mary's car when he ran off the bridge.
2257320,eng,Is this Tom's wife?
7543213,eng,Tom was still singing when I left.
321200,eng,There was only one warden on duty when the riot started.
241424,eng,We should not resort to arms to settle international disputes.
6609467,eng,Humans are too violent for world peace to ever become a reality.
3736951,eng,There's a call for you.
5079420,eng,The larks are warbling in the air.
8017437,eng,Mennad got depressed.
6577791,eng,Sami looks like Rambo.
6357273,eng,I did that on my own.
2603979,eng,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, thither ye cannot come."
3024230,eng,I was in Boston last month.
281964,eng,I'm four months pregnant.
2820847,eng,The box just fell to pieces all at once.
6230170,eng,Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
8838416,eng,Mary wore diamond earrings.
9092747,eng,Tom slept in class.
279143,eng,The discovery of electricity gave birth to an innumerable number of inventions.
3619602,eng,Tom has lived in three different countries.
8049853,eng,Tom was still single at that time.
10037809,eng,Tom was very handsome when he was in his teens.
7179730,eng,Tom said that I didn't look my age.
2956119,eng,Tom begged Mary not to leave.
7822320,eng,His health has declined.
6236353,eng,Tom is too diplomatic to do something like that.
822996,eng,She gave us a presence.
6244903,eng,I won't do that unless Tom helps me.
4397506,eng,We're doing OK.
9117408,eng,I'm going to go to Boston in October.
10461399,eng,He's putting in a lot of effort.
2540596,eng,I'd never say anything to anybody.
7154894,eng,Tom said he wanted to go to Australia.
329371,eng,What a crank he is!
10317638,eng,I ordered a book from Australia.
9291606,eng,"Thanksgiving smashes bubbles together, bringing in people from far and wide with different and sometimes unknown exposures to the virus."
10784356,eng,Shall we take a vote?
7182495,eng,Tom said he knew that Mary's children were afraid of him.
6241586,eng,Didn't you know Tom liked to go fishing?
5757580,eng,Tom is unrealistic.
7391106,eng,She started to empty her pockets.
2359128,eng,I've been here for months.
8415908,eng,Tom built a house near the river.
6524705,eng,I don't know anybody I can practice speaking French with.
7733681,eng,What's the score now?
7540771,eng,Tom doesn't plan to do that unless he has to.
7760615,eng,"“And never shall this leave my bosom,” said Lucy, as she hung the piece of gold round her neck, and concealed it with her handkerchief, “until you, Edgar Ravenswood, ask me to resign it to you; and, while I wear it, never shall that heart acknowledge another love than yours.”"
275172,eng,Taro's and Hanako's desk is small.
5134184,eng,"Ahhh, Paris at last. Where should we go first?"
6659118,eng,Tom couldn't remember Mary's last name.
3724534,eng,I agree we're taking a risk.
3422119,eng,Leave while you can.
277760,eng,It's always darkest before the dawn.
6869702,eng,You really should have been more clear about what you wanted.
6510535,eng,Tom and Mary say they can't give me what I want.
5744770,eng,I hope Tom gets the chance.
8508906,eng,I thought you said we were going there today.
9974809,eng,One can only envy you.
2892696,eng,What's going on with you two?
6350377,eng,I met Tom at the station.
4663666,eng,Couldn't those parts have been replaced?
3727461,eng,We would like some more beers.
4404735,eng,He really likes languages.
8514450,eng,He found out the truth from her.
2150553,eng,I have been studying Chinese for two years.
260500,eng,I asked him if he would go there the next day.
8083561,eng,Tom's a massive twat.
7199366,eng,I promise I'll be there by 2:30.
1304538,eng,He doesn't do stupid things like that.
8245917,eng,I asked Tom to tell me why Mary had changed her mind.
6498736,eng,Tom and Mary said they hoped they'd be allowed to do that.
6266413,eng,Tom said Mary was sorry for what she did.
10707366,eng,Bears eat everything.
9816836,eng,Barbecuing isn't allowed here.
3204338,eng,Have you told Tom what he should be doing?
2737082,eng,The boys were as nervous as the girls.
6649786,eng,Tom said that he hoped that Mary wouldn't do that anymore.
3201213,eng,I should've told you the truth.
9105739,eng,How long have you been in France?
3309966,eng,We've never seen Tom this worked up.
9234595,eng,"You don't know Tom very well, do you?"
5859833,eng,I asked Tom to help Mary.
4518739,eng,Many people believe that Tom and Mary are secretly in love with each other.
8454369,eng,I'm going to be your French teacher.
3358200,eng,You were refused entry because you were too drunk.
8476260,eng,He left that.
7159527,eng,I'll be flying to Australia next Monday.
6408936,eng,Mary said she thought Tom might need to do that with John.
3620400,eng,"It's a little late for that, don't you think?"
8413845,eng,It seems that it'll never work.
8575180,eng,She ran out of time.
4501091,eng,The children need adult supervision.
7541931,eng,Tom isn't a very good flying instructor.
6660394,eng,Are these all Tom's and mine?
4015584,eng,Did Tom say which way he'd be heading?
6606609,eng,"Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out. It needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren waste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky."
6241253,eng,I don't need to do that. Tom will do it.
10669906,eng,He's not stupider than you.
276603,eng,"Nobody envied the old man, who was a millionaire."
9154007,eng,It's too hot this summer.
2095462,eng,Is Tom someone special?
5181179,eng,Let's concentrate on what needs to be done today.
286785,eng,His professional career was bankrupt.
7163562,eng,Tom doesn't know why Mary is planning on going to Australia.
8911624,eng,I called the police right away.
4499300,eng,Would a little extra time help?
3000824,eng,I know this area like the back of my hand.
1747281,eng,Did I not anticipate this?
8953403,eng,This is an opportunity to make money.
26381,eng,If only I could speak English!
6421835,eng,Mary is smarter than you think she is.
7475927,eng,They didn't raise their voices.
6234218,eng,I didn't think Tom was the first one to do that.
5923977,eng,He picked up the feather.
10017457,eng,Yanni claims that Jesus was black.
1740241,eng,I draw almost every day.
7540731,eng,"Tom knew the answer, but didn't say anything."
66791,eng,"No, I'm afraid not."
8536552,eng,She looked at herself in the full-length mirror.
6272434,eng,Tom told Mary what he has to do.
241618,eng,It is high time Japan played an important role in the international community.
7258720,eng,Sami is going to leave.
7863141,eng,A similar thing might happen in Algeria.
8000335,eng,It's easy to read.
3824298,eng,Tom would like to see your new guitar.
6532352,eng,Spiders terrify me.
3162057,eng,See if there's anything you can do to help Tom.
7932300,eng,"How are you doing? ""A little better."""
6336789,eng,I wonder whether Tom is really studying French.
4497515,eng,Tom has refused to do what we requested.
6494728,eng,Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be able to do that in three hours.
4664679,eng,You shouldn't call people liars.
7196670,eng,Tom was surprised Mary quit her job.
1123666,eng,I'm not sure why Tom is against the idea.
42399,eng,That was the most interesting film that we had ever seen.
7937834,eng,I'm the one who made this.
10544157,eng,This year's official Christmas tree is a 5.5-meter-tall Fraser fir covered with white doves and ribbons bearing the names of U.S. states and territories.
3822956,eng,Maybe we should wait a little longer.
3917671,eng,I want to be here for him.
6258480,eng,Tom doesn't want to know why Mary wants to do that.
5356003,eng,"If you think I'm just going to stand here and take this, you've got another think coming!"
8700088,eng,Algeria is an ally of the Russian Federation.
8172355,eng,Have you seen any of the Harry Potter movies?
6892287,eng,People suck.
33473,eng,We crossed the lake in a boat.
24499,eng,Thousands of spectators got very excited.
812051,eng,"Your top does not provide enough midriff coverage, young lady."
7506734,eng,I know that Tom didn't know who should've done that.
8017426,eng,Mennad was silly.
2327227,eng,I found Tom quite amusing.
5136399,eng,I didn't dream in the night.
8910227,eng,He has paid the bill.
6518463,eng,How old were Tom and Mary when they died?
10533464,eng,I couldn't keep the tears from my eyes.
8514693,eng,She dedicated her book to him.
37649,eng,"At any rate, I must finish this work by tomorrow."
5062416,eng,I'm under the impression that she has fallen in love with me. What should I do?
7396973,eng,She says she's been asked to help.
6661828,eng,I heard Tom say that.
10255280,eng,He's guilty of theft.
1028218,eng,Tom picked out an interesting book for Mary to read.
5791216,eng,"An idealist is one who, on noticing that a rose smells better than a cabbage, concludes that it is also more nourishing."
5788723,eng,The cake was made in a 3D food printer.
8133649,eng,Tom asked to talk to the store manager.
8520491,eng,She stood behind him.
287221,eng,"Thanks to his efforts, all the crew were saved."
5604807,eng,When is your sister's flight?
6335576,eng,"The next time you're planning on doing that, let me know."
8287188,eng,He was really said about leaving his life behind.
2264340,eng,Now is the time to act.
7857279,eng,Algeria and China occasionally negotiate strategic economic ties.
6662996,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so stingy.
6873057,eng,I'm not very musically inclined.
2540339,eng,We've told you everything we know.
6341900,eng,I didn't think you really needed to do that.
6525753,eng,We're planning on staying together.
10207361,eng,Ziri pulled over next to Rima.
6262812,eng,Tom slept most of the afternoon.
7287051,eng,Sami needs to have a face to face conversation with Layla about this.
8793924,eng,Yanni and Skura were boring.
262803,eng,What reason did he give for being so late?
7275748,eng,Sami wasn't concerned with Layla.
8526326,eng,"He's dirty, isn't he?"
2951613,eng,Did Tom sign that confession voluntarily?
6411847,eng,What happened to Mary? I haven't seen her recently.
1970108,eng,I know Tom was your best friend.
6769179,eng,Tom can juggle five balls.
7320959,eng,Sami knew what kind of guy Farid was.
6495282,eng,It would've been nice if Tom and Mary had told us they'd be late.
6935498,eng,Tom and I've known each other a long time.
3651024,eng,"Globally, the 10 warmest years on record all occurred since 1998."
7394907,eng,He just told us that he got fired.
251124,eng,One of my hobbies is making artificial flowers.
6717734,eng,Sami brought the gas can there.
6709848,eng,Sami begged for mercy.
5333589,eng,I think I should've asked Tom to help.
2157661,eng,Do not intervene in matters which do not concern you!
7307360,eng,Sami worked hard to make money.
2588749,eng,She's in love with her best friend.
1709222,eng,I authorize my workers to leave early.
2240911,eng,What is your destination?
931490,eng,"She looks young, but in reality she's over 40."
7404190,eng,She said she'd do it later.
6091956,eng,Aren't you from here?
3330540,eng,I'm not ambitious enough.
8881873,eng,I thought I was going to be happy here.
8125374,eng,I miss hugging you.
6898046,eng,"You aren't really asking people to believe that, are you?"
4017405,eng,Is that what you're worried about?
7239935,eng,I know that I have to do better.
3434195,eng,Tom is trying too hard.
6567208,eng,Sami never took the stand.
8431821,eng,"We'd like to take on more apprentices, but unfortunately we can't find any."
6495093,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought they might be required to do that.
9026745,eng,We liked the film a lot.
284379,eng,He is my type!
6261154,eng,I don't like being criticized.
10596474,eng,I asked Tom for his help.
9337654,eng,When does summer break start?
8977199,eng,Is this bread fresh?
7681764,eng,They accomplished their homework.
3910871,eng,I recognized him.
10022109,eng,"Unfortunately, that rumour proved to be true."
245849,eng,I used to play alone when I was a child.
7471306,eng,Tom and Mary didn't let me in on their secret.
6348884,eng,I didn't know Tom was absent.
3823650,eng,My legs hurt.
2612052,eng,She isn't doing her homework. She's reading a book.
7416785,eng,Go and have fun.
6236530,eng,Tom didn't like beer the first time he tried it.
7961577,eng,I decided to text her.
8495562,eng,I also know a thing or two about cooking.
1923403,eng,We heard what sounded like gunshots.
2045850,eng,It's as beautiful as you said it would be.
2423472,eng,Miami is the largest city in Florida.
19865,eng,The old church on the hill dates back to the twelfth century.
9953833,eng,Tom doesn't go out very often.
8946574,eng,Tom won't ever be forgotten.
5119381,eng,"If a tree falls in the forest, and there's nobody around to hear, does it make a sound?"
2641693,eng,Tom and Mary recognized each other.
6230748,eng,It's snowing where Tom is.
9483349,eng,It's not polite to say that.
1025898,eng,Tom doesn't work as hard as he used to.
4537844,eng,She has baked a cake for lunch.
260178,eng,I am to meet him there.
9267841,eng,Tom walked to the corner.
2916598,eng,Thinking about it still makes me angry.
6265384,eng,Tom spent a lot of time talking with Mary.
287172,eng,He has a straight-A report card.
6738169,eng,I told Tom he didn't need to do that.
6867898,eng,Tom said that wasn't the main reason why Mary should have done that.
6352445,eng,I hope to leave next weekend.
8303133,eng,How many people will be there?
10225294,eng,Ziri's wife is very attractive.
7382213,eng,Mary rinsed her mouth.
6258978,eng,Tom said he knew Mary might need to do that today.
10720845,eng,Please help.
26977,eng,"The rain being over, they went on with the game."
2982339,eng,He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger.
9511336,eng,Yanni used to be a Christian. Now he's Muslim.
1088491,eng,"She looks young, but actually she's older than you are."
7562934,eng,I think we are still too young.
10578221,eng,"If anyone can convince Tom to join our team, it's Mary."
7992054,eng,Sami never wears pink clothing.
5834805,eng,Tom is serving a life sentence.
6421780,eng,Mary liked Tom as soon as she met him.
1751590,eng,He knows how to dive.
10074393,eng,I want your life blood!
4014390,eng,Could you excuse me for a minute?
10719047,eng,You can't fit a round peg in a square hole.
1885953,eng,How bad is the damage?
300644,eng,He studied all the harder for being praised by his teacher.
10730693,eng,Do you like going to baseball games?
7538870,eng,Tom picked up a piece of wood that he saw lying on the ground.
7538292,eng,"Tom can feed himself, can't he?"
9771439,eng,Yanni loved Algeria.
7243938,eng,Sami came to wash the dishes.
7194161,eng,I didn't think Tom would be in Australia last weekend.
7236501,eng,I suspect Tom doesn't have to do that anymore.
2626783,eng,He came to Japan when he was a boy.
6227478,eng,I didn't believe that Tom was capable of doing such a thing.
1742353,eng,The young ones wasted their money on drinks.
6247703,eng,There's something I don't understand.
5825719,eng,I never expected Tom to do that.
2640621,eng,Tom plans to drive from Boston to Chicago.
2888238,eng,Do you think Tom is having fun?
7229612,eng,Sami and Layla were going to the same high school.
8340704,eng,I don't know who those guys are.
306327,eng,They sent my suitcase to London by mistake.
48067,eng,The candidate is running for mayor.
6447274,eng,Tom slept in the guest bedroom.
9127311,eng,Drink water!
24810,eng,I could not see anything.
272671,eng,Last time I had a breech delivery.
4498951,eng,Tom said he isn't going to be here tomorrow.
7156988,eng,I've been in Australia since October.
3367222,eng,That was a misunderstanding!
10121901,eng,We need to take charge once more.
9210682,eng,What's dermatology?
246666,eng,The bell had already rung when I got to school.
6412546,eng,Mary told me that she thought Tom was intelligent.
9824666,eng,Yanni and Skura were both about the same age as Ziri.
6664498,eng,I don't like milk in my coffee.
9970494,eng,This syringe is supplied with the repair kit.
2540335,eng,Why did you ask Tom that question?
3076516,eng,Tom brews his own beer.
2721201,eng,He isn't so tall.
10228741,eng,Ziri called that number immediately.
312652,eng,She speaks not only English but also French.
4964245,eng,He gave money to many.
6346907,eng,Tom didn't have much of an appetite.
5776174,eng,Add a pinch of salt.
8198010,eng,Is this her sack?
8063796,eng,We're boiling water.
2408495,eng,I think we're even.
5499381,eng,Stop goofing off and get back to work!
6658127,eng,Tom asked Mary if he could borrow her umbrella.
29569,eng,Lucy should be in the kitchen now.
6271655,eng,Tom and I had an argument.
284365,eng,He is just the man for the job.
6435136,eng,Has Tom ever lied to you about anything?
7408309,eng,They made this bookcase by themselves.
2387843,eng,I needed to eat.
10506406,eng,We saw some old houses being torn down.
7374552,eng,Mary told me that she wanted a lawyer.
8315992,eng,Do you know what this medicine is for? When did they prescribe it to you?
8122871,eng,Algeria has big oil reserves.
8015314,eng,I want to help my parents.
8287181,eng,He came to Algeria for a two-week holiday.
318872,eng,"Father is busy, so I will go instead."
6522131,eng,Why do Tom and Mary hate you?
6343640,eng,I'd like to know why you didn't do that.
7403218,eng,"He didn't seem sad, did he?"
6348630,eng,Tom seemed to have caught a cold.
3155755,eng,Tom put on a coat.
3184186,eng,I think Tom is imaginative.
2537775,eng,Let me tell you what happened to me last night.
2796896,eng,We've been pals for years.
5659514,eng,I wonder if Tom could do a good job.
3902117,eng,Tom was searching for his wife Mary.
6513321,eng,I'm sure Tom and Mary know what they're doing.
3729574,eng,"Hey, you're in a good mood today."
2221050,eng,He slipped out the back door.
4769336,eng,I will shoot anyone who doubts my mercy.
31059,eng,I might have to be very angry with you if you were to come alone.
3424408,eng,I'll do whatever I need to do.
7178660,eng,Tom said that Mary isn't retired.
4895424,eng,Did you get your girlfriend a souvenir?
8821082,eng,"We teach children, but we also have to learn from them."
2064387,eng,Could you do something for me?
6376576,eng,Imagine if that news gets out?
7177960,eng,Tom said that Mary thought he shouldn't do that anymore.
4731512,eng,Tom is fairly well known.
3726448,eng,Your lives are in great danger.
7130172,eng,Tom didn't know how to express his feelings.
329622,eng,"There were many journalists who praised Ogawa with, ""bravo, good show!"""
2030099,eng,She's done her homework.
4495940,eng,Tom was born on the same day that his grandfather died.
2375688,eng,Mary is Canadian.
6993480,eng,National parkways are made up of scenic road and surrounding land. They were designed to give people driving cars a chance to see beautiful parts of the country.
2545646,eng,"You're right, of course."
6647599,eng,Tom thinks doing that is a good idea.
8382482,eng,Tom won the first prize.
8032121,eng,Do you reckon Tom will agree to do that?
50064,eng,The tie doesn't go with my dress.
2091198,eng,No one is allowed to go there.
10509047,eng,I won't be able to do my homework without a computer.
7186078,eng,I'm sorry that I'm calling you at work.
9640054,eng,"Tom also needs to do that, doesn't he?"
6232779,eng,"You didn't have enough energy to do that, did you?"
10619187,eng,"Is that an alder tree, or is it a birch?"
2353693,eng,We are in a pretty scrape!
7501575,eng,Tom realized that the car parked in front of Mary's house was John's.
3734647,eng,I tried my best to help Tom.
10078176,eng,Millions of Algerians are relying upon farming.
1531117,eng,My computer's acting up.
3820286,eng,Tom sent me that.
6411462,eng,Mary said that she didn't really feel like laughing.
303348,eng,He acquiesced in his father's decision.
240255,eng,Don't get me wrong.
8781016,eng,We didn't get any instructions. I guess we'll just muddle through and make the best of things.
304349,eng,He is a brave man.
10077902,eng,Can Tebboune achieve an economic miracle in Algeria?
6254535,eng,We should've done that yesterday.
10616833,eng,"I'm getting used to the term ""furry""."
7492708,eng,That isn't the best solution.
5070077,eng,Mary often wears high heels.
3181512,eng,Are they talking about Tom?
286592,eng,His car looks as good as new.
8480040,eng,He's a war hero.
17370,eng,I'm not going out on a limb for you because you never helped me before.
10555314,eng,My grandad likes to go rambling.
3287167,eng,I'm sure we can work something out.
4016318,eng,Tom went outside to see what Mary was doing.
7826522,eng,I didn't expect to see you here at all.
6938324,eng,We had a flood.
5827469,eng,Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born yet for missing it.
5828241,eng,They have taken away all the garbage.
8160574,eng,I'm still not too old to become a world-famous tennis player.
6355637,eng,Please turn to the left.
7772521,eng,It is not easy to read.
7864914,eng,Algeria imports almost everything from China.
3259923,eng,She has a pale complexion.
57915,eng,We can get three stations in this area.
73911,eng,"There, said the granddaughter, ""that's just the place."""
68802,eng,You remind me of your father.
6501584,eng,Tom and Mary did everything they thought they had to do.
8515734,eng,She says she won't shake hands with him.
7475429,eng,They learned from their mistakes.
8125207,eng,Thousands of delegates are expected to gather at Geneva’s cavernous Palexpo Exhibition center.
2134731,eng,A man like me needs a hat.
6850465,eng,"Mary, is there a legal term defined as 'Per translationem culpa posito sanguine'? ""No, Tom, you just made that up."" ""Mary, you're under arrest for the murder of Richard Britteridge."" ""Do you mean one of the original Mayflower passengers?"" ""Where were you on the night of Wednesday, December 20th, 1620?"""
7824282,eng,Tom is our youngest son.
8514484,eng,He got a surprise visit from her.
7114646,eng,I know the risks involved.
6220155,eng,Anyone may do that.
311061,eng,Such an idea is abhorrent to her.
2731737,eng,She comes from the north.
3907504,eng,What's your connection to him?
3161825,eng,Tom requested our help.
65640,eng,The Ugandans depend on their coffee crop to bring money into the country.
5793768,eng,I like this restaurant.
6097661,eng,Do you think Tom would enjoying doing that?
3758912,eng,"Yet, his troubles are not over."
6429276,eng,Mary has made her choice.
324602,eng,"Dinner finished, they enjoyed playing cards."
9488867,eng,Thanks once again for everything you've done for us.
10677612,eng,Ziri's house has this cottage look.
9230834,eng,God forgive me.
6570580,eng,Tom was sitting on a yoga ball.
10113938,eng,We would've won if it wasn't for that slip-up.
6666398,eng,I can't believe our luck.
7840923,eng,Armin is a Japanese citizen.
6048999,eng,Am I going to lose everything?
319926,eng,Prices will rise in course of time.
5753619,eng,What are your hours?
10651610,eng,Tom's condition isn't good.
8137268,eng,Let's go fishing together sometime.
7735770,eng,"Tom is busy this afternoon, isn't he?"
3713960,eng,Would you tell me your email address?
6106034,eng,I've watched many French movies.
3001605,eng,Tom wasn't interested in learning how to cook Chinese food. He just wanted to eat it.
3219285,eng,He's the best thing that ever happened to me.
7175496,eng,Tom thought that Mary wouldn't need to do that.
7519974,eng,I doubt that Tom has to do that.
7515666,eng,Tom did what he felt that he had to do.
10018326,eng,"During his lifetime, he was always deprived of date fruits; when he died, he was offered a whole bunch."
3733394,eng,It's not there.
7390779,eng,He returned to his office.
257990,eng,I saw the children walk across the street.
10325938,eng,I had a funny dream the night before last.
6514498,eng,Tom and Mary won't go camping by themselves.
6125016,eng,Tom told Mary why John doesn't like her.
399492,eng,"If my boy had not been killed in the traffic accident, he would be a college student now."
10369213,eng,I met Tom in French class at Harvard.
803304,eng,He met with reporters to talk about his decision.
2683876,eng,You had better not speak.
7348369,eng,Long live the gerontocracy!
6947446,eng,Tom is a set designer.
7288550,eng,Sami needed to learn how to socialize.
5087395,eng,That's exactly the way it happened.
1482011,eng,"Bollocks, where in God's name did I put my house keys?"
8905141,eng,I like soup.
7444806,eng,They told me that they're tired.
9518136,eng,Don't be that guy.
5732906,eng,I've been doing a lot of work.
3954985,eng,The methods of communication are determined by their cultures.
1440826,eng,"I was going to buy a new table, but my husband fixed the broken leg."
1961854,eng,I thought your middle name was Tom.
6270907,eng,Tom smiled when Mary winked at him.
7950190,eng,Mary is an anarcho-syndicalist.
9178493,eng,I have so many things to do.
8216099,eng,Put some paper in the copy machine.
8539372,eng,What does that have to do with her?
9288761,eng,It is possible that patients may no longer be able to receive optimal care everywhere.
7774159,eng,Do you want some more time?
1773396,eng,You party too hard.
7405015,eng,She says that she's busy.
7401277,eng,She looks like she's confident.
6492553,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought they might be the only ones who wanted to do that.
3631377,eng,Thank you for shopping with us!
3172309,eng,Can I take it?
6419028,eng,Mary will likely lose everything she has.
9735826,eng,Yanni got a big plate of food.
3723076,eng,"Someone told you I was coming, I hope."
2538563,eng,I wonder if anybody knows how to do this.
3916220,eng,I have to get them help us.
8146165,eng,Honeydew comes from Algeria.
7513611,eng,Tom has never told anyone why he did that.
6685072,eng,The plane was unable to take off due to the storm.
6653646,eng,Tom said he hopes that Mary won't need to do that.
2248897,eng,It was useful.
7213483,eng,Sami would buy Layla lunch.
10471471,eng,"Going door to door, they greet their neighbors by saying ""Trick or treat!"" in exchange for candy."
5794270,eng,"The cannons opened fire, mowing down the first wave with grapeshot."
8535463,eng,She said she saw him sitting in the park by himself.
3474649,eng,Tom's hardly likely to admit that he's wrong.
259066,eng,I saw her last week.
2549934,eng,"Everything was fine, except the weather."
33230,eng,"Bob came here, didn't he?"
2290893,eng,Your shoe stinks.
5226035,eng,"I believe, indeed, that overemphasis on the purely intellectual attitude, often directed solely to the practical and factual, in our education, has led directly to the impairment of ethical values."
9787536,eng,"Do you mind if I hang out with you? ""Sure. Why not?"""
6043597,eng,Sami was the Donald Trump of Cairo.
6527054,eng,"I might be able do that today, but I'm not sure."
6352915,eng,Tom looks like he's furious.
6433607,eng,Tom said he wasn't ready to become a father.
6422397,eng,Mary said she'd be afraid to do that.
3271534,eng,What more could one ask for?
7214747,eng,Tom told me that he wanted to do that tomorrow.
7517257,eng,I know Tom used to be a prison guard.
6425936,eng,Mary says she isn't ready to go.
8567861,eng,Are there any Muslims in North Korea?
313457,eng,She is just started for your house.
6492760,eng,You should tell Tom and Mary that John wants them to show him how to do that.
7982056,eng,Sami raped Layla in his living room.
5422643,eng,Everybody knows me.
1954269,eng,Get down.
707224,eng,He has studied the possibility of a collaboration.
2199374,eng,"He has two daughters, both married."
1095959,eng,Tom and Mary have very different opinions.
9933957,eng,Everybody says that Tom is a good man.
272528,eng,It was snowing thick and fast.
8192429,eng,Tom went to his daughter's concert.
6957698,eng,"What's this, Dawson! he cried. ""No gossiping! Go about your business!"""
285977,eng,I was disillusioned at his married life.
953612,eng,I shouldn't have to put up with this noise.
7517491,eng,Doesn't Tom know that you can't swim?
6988991,eng,Love makes life easier.
9344033,eng,I'll start reading the manga when I'm done watching the anime.
8581046,eng,Tom shut his door.
6331917,eng,"At least one Native American group, the Hopi Tribe, also has a tradition involving clown-like characters."
680281,eng,Atoms are in everything.
6422556,eng,Mary may talk to Tom if she wants to.
10228880,eng,Ziri and Rima were good friends.
3086154,eng,I am in Bilthoven.
7870212,eng,Tom is much heavier than I am.
6873985,eng,That must have been difficult.
10019473,eng,Tom and I didn't eat together.
9564642,eng,"At night, the trains run less frequently."
7197688,eng,It isn't like Tom to be late.
64127,eng,It is good to be kind to old people.
8540760,eng,What am I good for?
6022958,eng,The people of this country are sick and tired of politics as usual.
283841,eng,Do you know the town where he lives?
953685,eng,I used to dream about being able to play chess really well.
9153722,eng,I like taking walks by myself.
10713713,eng,The cars whose wheels are dirty need to be washed.
7240597,eng,I know it's highly unlikely that anyone can help me.
4558669,eng,Let's ask her.
10041103,eng,Yanni explained all that.
6662555,eng,Tom is one of the best cooks I know.
3204670,eng,Why didn't you tell me you'd already done that?
4481837,eng,She arrived from Japan at the age of 10.
68008,eng,I can't endure that noise a moment longer.
17669,eng,Did any of you gentlemen wait on this man?
5643368,eng,I don't think that that's fair.
4017256,eng,Shouldn't you be at work already?
8503477,eng,He went to college in the capital.
18196,eng,You should allow an hour to go to the airport.
3151446,eng,Give me your cell phone.
6515713,eng,Tom and Mary still call their father Daddy.
10303433,eng,She's always quick to respond to criticism.
8536766,eng,He came to his senses and decided to turn himself in to the police.
9811256,eng,Tom spent the whole weekend partying.
3723727,eng,Tom doesn't have any enemies I can't think of.
7173069,eng,I thought that Tom would at least understand the situation.
7457687,eng,Why did she quit using Twitter?
237802,eng,An army is a nation within a nation; it is one of the vices of our age.
8290749,eng,I think that that's an important point.
295962,eng,He delegated his authority to his competent assistant.
6222687,eng,Doing that won't be very difficult.
10054548,eng,They write books.
5851792,eng,Tom is currently married to Mary.
7440777,eng,They said they would buy it.
6815077,eng,It's a pity Tom isn't here.
2839224,eng,In the mornings I'm very lazy and don't want to do anything.
4253034,eng,This is a map of Ninohe District.
10049802,eng,He’s such a monster.
1954501,eng,You can't learn a foreign language in just a couple of weeks.
269841,eng,I want something dry.
6234157,eng,Do you really think it would be tough to do that?
5293069,eng,We're going to the beach. Would you like to go with us?
6952754,eng,What problems did they run into?
2279324,eng,Tom didn't bother to answer.
7505472,eng,Tom informed me that the bridge was about to collapse.
8186227,eng,Tom has decided to seek professional help.
681712,eng,Tom performs in a jazz club three nights a week.
6607981,eng,Where is she from?
6384248,eng,Sami is mysterious.
282888,eng,I think it's a great pity that he died so young.
4262613,eng,Hi fellas!
6502192,eng,Tom and Mary thought they heard a mouse in the kitchen.
34901,eng,May I play the piano?
10715906,eng,"Tom likes skiing, but I don't."
8385933,eng,Did I sing that song OK?
3825156,eng,Tom wondered what Mary had been doing.
3258017,eng,English is spoken everywhere in the world now.
7002754,eng,Tom's doctor advised him to give up smoking.
3731373,eng,Tom threw himself into his work.
5883110,eng,Fadil wasn't acting like a guilty man.
9116521,eng,Yanni uses the F-word every second.
6694052,eng,Sami had no intention of reconciling with Layla.
3258621,eng,It is cold outside today.
3455395,eng,"In Esperanto, the penultimate syllable is always stressed."
8528442,eng,"She's doing OK so far, isn't she?"
6980481,eng,"You can imagine, Dr. Watson, how pleased I was at such an extraordinary bit of good fortune."
8962325,eng,"The aging survivors of the world's first atomic bombing gathered once again in Hiroshima, Japan, Thursday to observe the 75th anniversary of the attack."
6196089,eng,You look alarmed.
7232444,eng,I don't think I'm going to do that anytime soon.
10663627,eng,Tom said he's been asked not to help Mary.
6499691,eng,How did you find out that Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
2470812,eng,He broke both his legs.
2011390,eng,Who wants a drink?
4017401,eng,Tom was late for class yesterday because he had an accident.
7543939,eng,Tom will get dizzy doing that.
7470535,eng,Tom and Mary say that they aren't afraid of ghosts.
4012565,eng,Are you sure we have enough time?
1943883,eng,Stop! There's a deer on the road.
6649615,eng,Tom said that he knew he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
5508212,eng,We've got more work to do.
8458769,eng,These are the only living Wollemi pines found anywhere on the planet in their natural environment.
3349585,eng,There are rumors that they broke up.
7383392,eng,She didn't identify herself.
273248,eng,"Happening in wartime, this would amount to disaster."
10240325,eng,"When I crashed the family car, my father was so mad that he said he was going to disown me."
6426429,eng,Mary told me she was depressed.
8098758,eng,I got shudders all of a sudden. It can't be good.
1084120,eng,"Good-bye, Sayoko!"
7970283,eng,Sami is having a huge party.
1164789,eng,Mr. Charles Baskerville gave this family paper to me.
1666470,eng,Four thousand throats may be cut in one night by a running man.
5936826,eng,I'll never tell you what you have to do.
8182031,eng,Tom knew that he had a job to do.
6653180,eng,Tom said that he planned to stay inside all day and read a book.
2546641,eng,I'm afraid of drowning.
7126610,eng,It happened Monday morning at Tom's.
9962045,eng,These light bulbs are very bright.
6348205,eng,How many days ago did that happen?
7509003,eng,Tom laughed and everybody else laughed with him.
10324487,eng,The first night was awful.
292061,eng,He is eager to go there.
6423153,eng,Mary said that she was very unhappy.
7051163,eng,Tom believes in the ancient Greek gods.
250976,eng,My sister has her hair done each week.
6503218,eng,I know Tom and Mary haven't forgotten how to do that.
9250881,eng,I think I've already told you about it.
6354702,eng,Don't worry. I'll do that.
8412795,eng,I probably won't be forgiven.
1528930,eng,That's very kind of you to say that.
6356315,eng,Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't cry.
3408265,eng,The rumors were false.
10193535,eng,Are there many Assyrian speakers in Australia?
6305823,eng,"Calm down, we've already settled the matter of the dog."
72289,eng,It is nine. I'm afraid I must be leaving now.
10666405,eng,I know that Tom told Mary he could do that.
6653388,eng,Tom said that he learned how to do that from Mary.
9172066,eng,Tom laughed at us.
9161088,eng,Can you get down here?
7199668,eng,Sami didn't know what the fuck he was doing.
1408614,eng,She's three years older than I am.
8515371,eng,She said she wanted to marry him.
9023199,eng,“What is that thing?” “It's not a thing. It flies. It's an airplane. It's my plane.”
4485936,eng,I don't know how to explain how Tom did that.
314572,eng,I found her in tears in her room.
2250917,eng,That sounds intriguing.
6985219,eng,Ask Tom for a cut from the door.
5850157,eng,I'm sure I won't like it.
7208757,eng,Sami was Layla's older brother.
10040125,eng,I think that Tom doesn't love his wife anymore.
6229161,eng,"Tom is married now, so he can't go drinking every weekend with his friends like he used to."
2711909,eng,Hunger can make people do stupid things.
1256544,eng,"When the input exceeds a certain threshold, an output signal is instantaneously released."
1934761,eng,You forgot our wedding anniversary.
10225350,eng,Ziri's barbecue is burning.
299739,eng,It took him a while to realize the situation.
7202026,eng,Sami thought Layla got fired.
2538641,eng,Tom pulled some money out of his pocket.
7173030,eng,I thought that Tom wasn't in prison anymore.
3733501,eng,Stupidity is no excuse.
8634469,eng,The police department asked all criminal activities and nefarious behavior to cease.
5849208,eng,I thought Tom didn't have a driver's license.
7174941,eng,Tom thought that he'd forgotten to lock the door.
6954608,eng,"Tom is good at biology, isn't he?"
20556,eng,There is a fan on the desk.
6418465,eng,Mary said that she didn't mean to be rude.
44947,eng,"That proposal may be a way to kill two birds with one stone, but we also have to be careful not to get greedy and spoil everything."
3360369,eng,Do you really think I can do this?
1535807,eng,They do have a TV.
265971,eng,Don't forget to put a stamp on your letter.
6572313,eng,Mary gasped when she saw the ring.
8268240,eng,Tom is used to getting his way.
8374732,eng,You were smoking.
8456352,eng,We need to bury our dog.
6664866,eng,I have an important job to do.
248115,eng,We spent a good deal of money on the project.
6033532,eng,I am unhappy.
2926435,eng,Tom became anorexic when he was in high school.
7230227,eng,I don't think that there's any need for Tom to attend the meeting.
8276466,eng,I think that I've sprained my back.
9990467,eng,Many French colonial buildings still shape Central Algiers today.
8052923,eng,Go get your helmets.
3327121,eng,Go grab a drink.
10641097,eng,I miss everything about you.
60344,eng,There are a lot of beautiful songs on these records.
680147,eng,Here is their photo album.
63695,eng,I like the way you walk.
3185365,eng,Tom decided to stay three more days.
3831428,eng,Your mother wants you to come home.
6436514,eng,Tom told Mary he needed some money.
6409059,eng,Mary ate the chocolate chip cookies that Tom made for her.
6238536,eng,How many cups of coffee do you drink a week?
2245757,eng,I feel vulnerable.
6656963,eng,"I don't go fishing much now, but I used to a lot."
1923439,eng,"I'm pretty sure Tom went outside before the gunshot, not after."
3904433,eng,Tom did warn them.
402901,eng,Why is it the mass media didn't report this?
7406002,eng,They have to travel a lot for their jobs.
60596,eng,The bottle is made of glass.
6690996,eng,Sami felt disrespected.
8888129,eng,Hold the microphone a bit further away from your mouth.
10026927,eng,Yanni died before getting baptized.
10586102,eng,I've lived in Boston for about thirty years.
1025162,eng,Tom is a Muslim.
2952423,eng,"I sometimes go to the local pool to swim, but I prefer swimming in the ocean."
419896,eng,You should read books beneficial to you.
314688,eng,She felt insecure about her future.
2539678,eng,Tom appears to be telling the truth.
2606050,eng,"I've had a cold for one week, and I still haven't got better."
5346744,eng,My mom is worried.
1983977,eng,It's never too late to say no.
4310701,eng,"He also discovered sunspots, the dark areas of the Sun. He saw that the planet Venus has light and dark phases just like the Moon. These discoveries provided empirical information that proved that the Sun is at the center of the Solar System, as Nicholas Copernicus had predicted."
7542180,eng,Tom only answered some of my questions.
9711342,eng,We could certainly use the help.
10204225,eng,Drink your juice.
5067902,eng,Perseverance conquers the worst obstacles.
682264,eng,The workers united to solve the problem.
5726085,eng,We're now waiting for the result.
4015900,eng,What are you apologizing for?
3024462,eng,Did it rain in Boston while you were there?
8321613,eng,His stepsister just died a year ago.
7307244,eng,Sami was having panick attacks.
9712375,eng,"When Yanni saw those punks, he was a little frightened."
1796933,eng,Nobody wanted to trust my country.
3822098,eng,What else will you need?
2542715,eng,Would you please check those?
8687218,eng,We all want that.
6392958,eng,Mary was mesmerized.
10289237,eng,I could get you kicked out of here.
7394827,eng,He loved apples when he was a kid.
8098586,eng,The arms industry yields a profit but also suffering.
8398129,eng,He kept her photo.
3501306,eng,No man is an island.
6776724,eng,What was your favorite subject in junior high school?
9067053,eng,I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as Β 612.
6443411,eng,I would be more than happy to pay.
1573743,eng,What is this vase made of?
7321216,eng,Sami ended up dancing with one of Layla's friends.
71421,eng,"As you treat me, so will I treat you."
1839103,eng,"To put it bluntly, he's mistaken."
695239,eng,I bought the MP3 player.
619737,eng,"She was in dire straits, but made a virtue out of necessity."
8723202,eng,"Can you repair my computer? You're a programmer, after all."
6954677,eng,Blue isn't my favorite color.
1305736,eng,Glass has the ability to be broken under pressure.
8470086,eng,Tom has kids and grandkids.
10474463,eng,Southern Mongoloids or Sundadonts have infusions of Australoids.
5012313,eng,That movie ended up being a bore.
9207526,eng,We didn't say that.
5524534,eng,Tom wanted to talk to a lawyer.
10650319,eng,They paid his words a great deal of attention.
6379026,eng,We may now begin whenever we want.
2323213,eng,I don't think Tom will ever forgive me.
5851144,eng,I was very sick at that time.
8249832,eng,He was asked to give a talk about Islam.
5358167,eng,I believe people in Boston will help.
2953885,eng,We're about to go swimming.
8097847,eng,It grew luxuriantly.
6537985,eng,I need to know that Sami's affair is ending.
2057764,eng,Don't blame Tom.
2575953,eng,Bush believes in God.
5183307,eng,I'm still not satisfied.
8394496,eng,They did that after sex.
8750896,eng,English isn't easy for me.
3997826,eng,"It isn't easy, but it's possible."
8958413,eng,Why don't you offer to do that for Tom?
6990852,eng,The car was totaled.
7538046,eng,I suggest you ignore it.
7230398,eng,I don't think I'm the only one who's worried about that.
8340760,eng,I don't really understand that.
2565543,eng,That's not like him.
5093508,eng,The only way to increase happiness in the world is to divide it up.
7185791,eng,Sami's house creeped me out.
6266696,eng,Tom is accustomed to the cold.
7388906,eng,She's fine on her own.
1989389,eng,Our evidence is no more than a tiny sliver of solid knowledge amidst the vast bog of doubts and speculations.
286823,eng,When will his new novel come out?
51485,eng,I'm sorry. Would you mind turning around?
10517200,eng,They have been building the bridge for months. They have not finished building it yet.
10111316,eng,I don't like exercising.
7541731,eng,Tom figured out how to solve the problem.
443237,eng,And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
6342425,eng,Tom and I don't do that together very often.
7171652,eng,I thought you said that Tom was overweight.
6759855,eng,There aren't any musicians in my family.
5753495,eng,Answer the questions.
8477635,eng,He and I cried.
10172759,eng,The railway station is near the hotel.
6508771,eng,I told you Tom and Mary were really annoying.
6443353,eng,"There were two roads in the forest for me to choose between, and I chose the one least trodden, and I made all my choices at that very moment."
3342826,eng,You know Tom is lying.
7208552,eng,Sami was calling Layla names.
10258695,eng,Waste separation is no small matter.
326170,eng,We have enough time to catch the train.
6246960,eng,I think Tom would be undependable.
10021203,eng,Tom processes things differently than we do.
51647,eng,I love sports. I get that from my father.
7112199,eng,Why are you so bent out of shape?
7378660,eng,Mary told me that she'd be there.
10054453,eng,Tom uses the same password for every site.
10024092,eng,Yanni and Skura would never cross that line.
2917226,eng,The benefit of being a consulting detective is that I can pick and choose my clients.
1887495,eng,I know that I should be sleeping now.
57423,eng,Is there any tax on this?
10232871,eng,Ziri did something fun.
297756,eng,I wonder if he can reserve the flight for me.
7320825,eng,Sami gave Layla a heart necklace and heart earring.
8404457,eng,"He was born and raised in Algiers, Algeria."
7232593,eng,I don't think that Tom knows much about alligators.
6589063,eng,Do you have rubbing alcohol?
6347306,eng,Tom never really wanted to do that.
1638333,eng,What do you think of when you look at this photo?
8160850,eng,I learnt it wrong.
10103638,eng,Yanni and Skura don't share the same outlook on life.
8409690,eng,She's so charming.
9053086,eng,"Lakhdar Benkoula knows how ridiculous his ""scientific"" views sound."
9136169,eng,"When Yanni saw his mother, he had a solid lump in his throat."
6661788,eng,"If you think Tom is Canadian, you're wrong."
8248734,eng,He took his shahada four years ago.
6248632,eng,The only vegetarian here is Tom.
5214639,eng,I know they're a good team.
7515572,eng,Tom soon realized Mary was still alive.
7371712,eng,The candy is missing.
7237069,eng,Didn't you know very few people actually do that?
2538300,eng,Why didn't Tom tell Mary what he had done?
2642687,eng,Tom didn't seem to remember me.
2954475,eng,You do that so much better than I can.
10540975,eng,Children five and younger are free.
7376187,eng,Mary says that's her favorite movie.
6237182,eng,Tom is probably not going to do that very well.
6125340,eng,Tom will try to convince you to help him.
6049088,eng,Tom didn't do that very fast.
3151122,eng,You gave it to us.
2542522,eng,I'll determine how we proceed.
6517107,eng,Tom and Mary need us to show them the way.
8799439,eng,Can we make Mars habitable and turn it green?
3619425,eng,I'll bet Tom will know what to do.
6413066,eng,I asked Mary when she had started studying French.
6512536,eng,Tom and Mary don't want to talk with you.
326686,eng,"Will they be open this early in the morning? ""They'll let me in on sight."""
6267493,eng,Tom should've been skeptical.
8391135,eng,He hit on Skura's daughter.
10040292,eng,I will believe that Tom is alive only when I see him.
6335378,eng,Tom hardly ever waits for anyone.
8396154,eng,Can we talk about this in the morning?
3204550,eng,Tom has just told me that he found a new job.
963699,eng,The mountain is green.
6903635,eng,I must sleep a bit.
3436795,eng,Tom opened the door and stepped inside.
9451936,eng,Tom seemed a little offended.
6344871,eng,Tom didn't quite understand what to do.
2537838,eng,Tom wouldn't have left without saying goodbye.
2750336,eng,Why could the boy not tell how old his aunt was? - He could not tell it because he had not yet learnt large numbers in school.
8825763,eng,Does Tom have a backpack?
9855570,eng,Women have always liked him.
6225318,eng,I'm not going to allow Tom to do that anymore.
6228415,eng,"You don't have to do that, but it would be better if you did."
3913595,eng,We let them win.
7379511,eng,Mary said she wanted to do this.
8901141,eng,It's a nice view on the river.
297852,eng,He is envious of my good fortune.
6569170,eng,We need to replace our water heater.
5826374,eng,I was so excited that I couldn't sleep a wink.
8877044,eng,The dog is comfortable with her.
8516262,eng,He shouted at her.
7473607,eng,They had nobody to tell their story to.
3096121,eng,It's a pleasure to see you again.
6343251,eng,I'm glad to hear that Tom didn't win.
4711568,eng,Here's a list of difficult words I have compiled so far.
8866680,eng,She was sacked.
3024105,eng,It was raining hard in Boston.
8226668,eng,Tom Martin has been a lobsterman for 35 years.
5895524,eng,Layla played Fadil as a violin.
51524,eng,Mr Smith left Japan this morning.
7734860,eng,Tom will never hurt you.
6575016,eng,Sami went racing down this road at a 160 miles an hour.
278395,eng,"Walking along the street, I found a wallet."
37856,eng,I'm so hungry that I could eat a horse.
8376811,eng,Tom got caught driving a stolen car.
6259647,eng,Tom should've done that the way Mary told him to.
8526469,eng,"He's winning, isn't he?"
6985120,eng,Tom is a snake-oil salesman.
1954782,eng,I can't remember what Tom looks like.
8792382,eng,Yanni was plotting Skura's death.
3877523,eng,This cable has a tremendous strength.
6354896,eng,I thought Tom would show Mary how to do that.
3308362,eng,Did you notice how many pictures were on the mantel?
6339099,eng,You should ask Tom to tell you how to do that.
8296976,eng,I just wish that I knew what to say to Tom.
10450587,eng,"When I entered the room, they went quiet."
3919733,eng,Don't look at them.
3077136,eng,"One of the people I know in real life was trying to come up with a glove to increase your brain's functionality in taste, touch etc. I told him he was nuts but he still thinks it is the best thing since sliced bread!"
6520123,eng,I'm sure Tom and Mary are on their way.
6654592,eng,Tom said that he didn't smoke anymore.

3310275,eng,We've been over this before.
8916960,eng,Tom was here today.
5705232,eng,"Happy, happy Christmas, that can win us back to the delusions of our childish days; that can recall to the old man the pleasures of his youth; that can transport the sailor and the traveller, thousands of miles away, back to his own fire-side and his quiet home!"
484980,eng,He doesn't get jokes.
8479712,eng,He was homesick.
7218490,eng,Sami bought a funnel cake.
5280482,eng,You will give me this letter.
8608573,eng,You are in Algeria now.
10297015,eng,Ziri got caught there and then.
6871161,eng,That would have been awful.
9483196,eng,What do old people eat that young people don't?
6251508,eng,I didn't know Tom knew French.
6684323,eng,Tom's arms were folded across his chest.
9668201,eng,"You're all adults here, so start acting like adults."
5852421,eng,I don't have a house in Boston.
62253,eng,The price of coffee has come down.
39143,eng,Please turn on the TV.
6247327,eng,Tom has started doing that once a week.
6705503,eng,How much sugar do you want me to put in your coffee?
3891140,eng,Who removed them?
7123128,eng,Tom became interested in music.
6260916,eng,Tom asked Mary why she had never studied French.
6425965,eng,Mary said that she was very mad.
9435608,eng,I'll be popping into the post office on the way home.
7389506,eng,She said that she quit her job.
5817081,eng,Be quick.
953851,eng,I'm so glad that you asked me to give the opening speech tonight.
6266488,eng,Tom said Mary is going to do that anyway.
1256943,eng,He is hated by everyone.
9768881,eng,Yanni has 400 fig trees in his garden.
1392302,eng,Tom bought a webcam.
7079699,eng,Tom approaches.
3010257,eng,Both Tom and Mary blushed.
8511856,eng,Tom did admit that he was wrong.
5738092,eng,It hasn't changed one iota.
6711836,eng,Sami was no angel.
5902929,eng,I'm braver than Tom.
5371914,eng,There were only three children on the bus.
7198729,eng,It isn't about cost reduction.
7541681,eng,Tom lived here before he moved to Boston.
1153379,eng,I resent their rude attitude.
680665,eng,The girl denied saying bad things about her friend.
2456486,eng,He hung his blazer on a hanger because he didn't want it to get wrinkled.
7236685,eng,"I suspect Tom is at home, sleeping."
4177438,eng,"It might sound like I'm complaining, but I'm not."
4552607,eng,Tom is determined to do something.
9855572,eng,He's always liked women.
10094108,eng,We'll see what we can cobble together.
4158604,eng,This is just to confirm receipt of your letter.
7155274,eng,Would you go back to Australia if you had the chance?
10475056,eng,I hope they don't send me to prison.
7407861,eng,They're unpacking their clothes.
7364436,eng,They will forget each other.
6711804,eng,Sami wanted to talk about his family life.
267868,eng,The girl has a pure voice.
6482403,eng,I was able to do that much faster than Tom.
9518373,eng,"They declared a truce, finally."
6257016,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary would do that tomorrow.
6818581,eng,Tom has long arms.
10666086,eng,I'll never be separated from you and our son.
7513910,eng,I know that Tom could've done that better.
9765029,eng,Yanni wanted the prettiest girls.
3168381,eng,I want you to remember exactly what you said to Tom.
327716,eng,Location check: The parties involved themselves or their attendants should look over the place for the miai meeting in advance.
1664297,eng,How about tonight?
9958662,eng,Tom's explanation was very clear.
10275234,eng,I want to go to the ice rink.
963953,eng,iTunes has turned out to be a real cash cow for Apple.
6427012,eng,Mary sold her house in Boston.
71882,eng,I'm speechless.
6228102,eng,"I know I won't be able to do that, so I'm not even going to try."
10242888,eng,I'm going to Germany.
284367,eng,He is the very best baseball player in our school.
1532045,eng,I can only recommend that everyone give themselves three days to learn Toki Pona.
6717224,eng,Sami was on the other side.
8819584,eng,"This problem seems simple at first glance, but actually it's fairly complicated."
7383039,eng,He locked himself in the closet.
1789304,eng,I must know the truth about her.
707096,eng,It's very dangerous to swim in this river.
6515469,eng,Why are Tom and Mary coming to Boston?
7541813,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has done a nice job.
6256397,eng,We seldom see ducks around here.
9415583,eng,Tom is talking with his friend.
10766941,eng,"He told her something, and she laughed."
2646863,eng,Tom sipped his drink.
4729018,eng,The mango is the national fruit of several countries.
4713400,eng,I attended the hour-long presentation.
262135,eng,I will be seventeen next week.
2774963,eng,"If Tom did not have this pillow, he would miss it very much."
8341317,eng,I don't want to put you in an awkward position.
6515591,eng,Tom and Mary don't want to go hunting.
3910505,eng,I never saw her before today.
6414057,eng,Mary said she wasn't going to sign the contract.
2867275,eng,They know it.
3733614,eng,That's almost impossible to believe.
2408281,eng,I think Tom is looking at us.
8395218,eng,He's playing with your kids.
2359325,eng,I've been waiting for you all morning.
3964958,eng,Her boyfriend admitted later on that he's bisexual.
1064076,eng,I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your help.
6261431,eng,I can't continue working here.
6345612,eng,Tom will need to wait a while longer.
10226284,eng,Ziri collected swords.
4552466,eng,Her brother has been missing for a while now.
6576136,eng,Does this look silly?
6149678,eng,Death is common to every age.
47395,eng,The child was paralyzed with fear.
2168993,eng,How long have you known Luis?
4625852,eng,Quiet down!
6457965,eng,Tom warmed his hands by the fire.
303276,eng,His strength is much greater than that of an ordinary man.
3732493,eng,Tom seemed somewhat disappointed.
1773015,eng,It will do you no harm to find yourself ridiculous. Resign yourself to be the fool you are.
6476384,eng,Sami and Layla met in Christmas 1996.
6255497,eng,I don't need to worry about that.
5991110,eng,Tom almost caused an international incident.
301136,eng,He could be in the gymnasium.
9189284,eng,Be careful next time.
251532,eng,My brother fell off a tree and broke his leg.
6468629,eng,b_n converges to b.
9038875,eng,Tom wasn't told to wait.
70162,eng,Do you mean to do without an overcoat?
7453789,eng,I'm comfortable now.
3203709,eng,Tom told me he didn't have any enemies.
3133586,eng,"Right now, we have to find out what happened."
6662929,eng,I advised Tom to drink more milk.
10206214,eng,"The waves broke, and the backwash rushed through the pebbles."
10234228,eng,Rima always wore a bikini on the beach.
6616458,eng,I can't feel my feet.
6197129,eng,There’s a game called Minecraft that is about mining.
8170342,eng,You talk too fast and I can't understand everything you say.
7392081,eng,He says he doesn't think he snores.
6667076,eng,I admit I did that.
9860936,eng,He is very thorough and slow when he does his editing.
4495598,eng,The crowd was amazing.
6256452,eng,Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't say she has to do that.
4694950,eng,I don't think that's right.
6902717,eng,"You're the one who should pay the bill, aren't you?"
8988507,eng,Tom probably isn't going to be late for work this morning.
8780063,eng,We're taking the kittens to the humane society tomorrow afternoon.
6336411,eng,I wonder whether Tom thought we should do that.
7176464,eng,Tastes and colours are not debatable.
5257145,eng,Tom is part of the problem.
9516732,eng,"It's not raining hard, it's spitting."
49439,eng,The sound was distinct from here.
2542244,eng,Tom has helped us in the past.
1337754,eng,What should I do? I said to myself.
6812071,eng,I knew that Tom would find us.
1020310,eng,Do you like China?
794655,eng,"Unfortunately, three days ago a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off the Pacific coast of Japan's Tohoku region."
6335236,eng,Tom plans to go fishing.
2641624,eng,Tom said that you and he had lunch.
7512211,eng,I think that Tom might not actually do that.
4494152,eng,Tom is being hypocritical.
8396162,eng,I'd high five you if I could.
9419326,eng,"If you want to make something good, you may."
8694854,eng,You won't see me anymore.
2262787,eng,"Tom, we've arrived!"
1986836,eng,"He died leaving his widow and this one boy, with a small business, a long doctor's bill, and sad memories of the past."
10697788,eng,I guess I'll have to take the blame for what happened.
6531538,eng,Tom won't starve to death.
528541,eng,The Greeks also eat fish often.
3907004,eng,Can you get a message to them?
9953530,eng,Yanni reads 4% of the Quran every single day.
8574332,eng,Tom is our starting quarterback.
3444816,eng,You are going to be a new father!
2644562,eng,How is Tom related to you?
6509862,eng,I highly doubt Tom and Mary want to see you.
6419152,eng,"Mary says that she needs to do that, too."
9984821,eng,I'm not allowed to let you in there.
5877767,eng,Fadil sat in his house alone.
6777580,eng,Tom doesn't know the difference between linen and wool.
7403530,eng,She said that she's healthy.
9849258,eng,That's what Tom wants to avoid.
5744370,eng,This has been a blessing.
9611235,eng,One day we'll laugh about this.
4497675,eng,Maybe Tom has already done that.
3392588,eng,Let's see what Tom has to offer.
7511014,eng,I knew that Tom was afraid of his grandfather.
10130646,eng,Never let Tom see you do that.
6844878,eng,Being a single parent isn't easy.
10720481,eng,You should probably get to bed early tonight.
1027452,eng,I wonder if Tom misses me when I'm gone.
1771720,eng,She's a junior employee.
8755370,eng,"Some callers are experiencing panic attacks when reaching us, and our volunteers help them work through the panic until they're able to talk about the issue."
6262844,eng,Tom says he hopes Mary won't have to do that.
3422755,eng,I hardly speak French at all.
9248693,eng,I'm dreaming of going to Japan.
5615925,eng,I always told Tom the truth.
7849746,eng,They are in Algeria.
9237964,eng,It was impossible to get it down from the tree.
2099616,eng,There's a whole lot of shaking going on.
3490580,eng,Tom wasn't there today.
4870482,eng,Don't skip over any details.
1079102,eng,Piss off!
3360484,eng,You're difficult to work with.
8527022,eng,"He's still there, isn't he?"
7390023,eng,He makes his own bread.
9145940,eng,The meeting was put off until next Monday.
6287102,eng,No one was responsible for the great Wall Street crash. No one engineered the speculation that preceded it. Both were the product of free choice and decision of hundreds of thousands of individuals.
9149719,eng,He was so drunk he couldn't stand up.
6812479,eng,You shouldn't be dressed that way.
4749473,eng,What language is this?
2643450,eng,Why did they do this to you?
3178537,eng,That's the reason we need to leave.
9793529,eng,Yanni hit Skura once.
6424423,eng,Mary told us that she'd cooperate.
6650464,eng,Tom said Mary is the best cook he knows.
306589,eng,They fought to the last man.
6780548,eng,Will you warn Tom?
7519996,eng,How can I take care of everyone?
8515953,eng,He really thought he was going to lose her.
8909651,eng,Oh!! I just saw an apparition!!
9171181,eng,Here are their things.
3364175,eng,Why are there so many dishonest people in the world?
7520812,eng,I know that Tom is a gambler.
3792009,eng,"Sometimes, life is so unjust."
2681842,eng,Tom pulled a fast one on you.
3424046,eng,Tom might not be able to come.
10723961,eng,Tom could do nothing about that.
8996591,eng,The storm system known as Laura became a Category 1 hurricane Tuesday in the Gulf of Mexico and is expected to intensify as it hits warmer water.
5688248,eng,I'm excited to go back to Boston.
10681787,eng,Mary grew up in straitened circumstances.
9029694,eng,Tom wasn't asked to do that.
9073866,eng,The Kabyle dress was made in the nick of time.
7375374,eng,Mary said that she'd found something.
6289401,eng,These polarized sunglasses are great for driving.
3183953,eng,I think we'd better go.
4980730,eng,You feel more secure that I can't see your face on the Internet.
4484649,eng,Sometimes a flower should be enough to smile.
8588137,eng,This kind of thing can go on forever.
1857551,eng,"Many children will be going from door to door saying ""Trick or treat?"" on Halloween night."
242526,eng,I don't think I shall get through all this work this afternoon.
58758,eng,The status of a doctor is very high in this community.
267404,eng,The servant gradually adjusted to his new surroundings.
807589,eng,Improvements in technology helped them succeed.
10483756,eng,Dan is no longer welcome in our house.
9787771,eng,He never calls around this time.
4854093,eng,How can we spread Esperanto?
4493672,eng,Tom has a twin brother.
10551582,eng,What is the least visited country?
6350298,eng,Tom told me he intended to win.
5732990,eng,I think this is very positive.
308595,eng,I hit it off well with her.
1460071,eng,He was alone in the house.
4826300,eng,We both pretended nothing had happened.
10241242,eng,Ziri slept on the bus.
2771425,eng,Tom was absolutely miserable when his dog ran away.
7212604,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary was busy.
3966008,eng,I have been looking for a piano for my daughter.
10466976,eng,Shall we sing a song for you?
1830398,eng,Tom ate something.
6423556,eng,Mary didn't know that Tom loved her.
7199188,eng,Sami saved me.
253060,eng,I have never come across such a stubborn person.
7287756,eng,Sami was sitting on Layla's couch.
7159937,eng,Tom left for Australia as soon as he got Mary's call.
809739,eng,No doubt.
6107270,eng,Layla and Sami did their homework together.
9635503,eng,Violent movies have always been part of Yanni's life.
6421889,eng,Mary hardly ever does that by herself.
1456688,eng,Are your glasses prescription?
6273738,eng,Tom said Mary was frightened.
8717085,eng,The woman died shortly after giving birth.
2241642,eng,We'll work hard.
6223572,eng,It would've been hard to do that.
8402043,eng,This is Germany and people don't get fired for converting to Islam.
1994463,eng,"If Tom were in trouble, Mary would know."
8394433,eng,The bus is pretty empty.
3912976,eng,I wish I were more like you.
6409600,eng,Mary thought she probably shouldn't go there by herself.
8621108,eng,He's talking through his ass again.
1026147,eng,Tom doesn't have enough money.
7397023,eng,She says she hasn't done that yet.
7503201,eng,"I know that Tom is in the garage, working on his motorcycle."
6212452,eng,"As for Daphnis it was as if he had been stung, not kissed, by Chloe."
619732,eng,Peter always makes a mountain out of a molehill.
6807059,eng,Sami threatened to leak Layla's address.
9547889,eng,We have to see them.
3907436,eng,I've got to get to him.
4500824,eng,Tom lost his house.
6035795,eng,"My handwriting is so bad, even I can't read it."
7506747,eng,I know that Tom could probably force you to do that.
5257151,eng,Tom is an excellent singer.
7165196,eng,Sami was cleaning.
2773693,eng,I'm proud to be an Italian.
2011756,eng,I don't want any beans.
6332164,eng,Sami was riding the bus to work.
254787,eng,I regretted having done it.
8783956,eng,"I am a Christian. I am a Christian. I am a Christian. ""Are you a Christian?"" ""Yes, I am a Christian."""
10791610,eng,His little brother is a famous footballer.
7908186,eng,You can't really be serious.
3417594,eng,Tom is better at math than I am.
9045403,eng,Tom wasn't the only one eating.
8525859,eng,He found her where he expected her to be.
245374,eng,The work has just been done.
8250488,eng,Use your Berber.
6717923,eng,Sami is a clinical psychologist.
6607908,eng,We're here on vacation. We're staying at a hotel on the beach.
3731942,eng,What kind of shots did they give you?
6080746,eng,Do you think Tom got it right?
6246329,eng,I don't have any idea where Tom is.
8549838,eng,Scientists think that giraffes use infrasound to communicate over long distances.
1243558,eng,Don't forget your things.
8017498,eng,Mennad is saving up money to get his own condo.
3178512,eng,This must be confusing to you.
10090166,eng,"In Algeria, this level of growth is extremely impressive for this type of company."
2948334,eng,"Okay, I lied."
5008755,eng,It wasn't a long list.
10717707,eng,It has been a long winter.
2640261,eng,Tom pushed the door open and entered the room.
3168194,eng,One of the knives is missing.
10627265,eng,Why do we live in such a fucked-up world?
10741475,eng,The street was dimly lit.
8522596,eng,She jumped out of the bushes and scared him.
5744837,eng,It's going to get better.
6003794,eng,Tom took Mary to the nearest hospital.
9669092,eng,Are you absolutely sure that's going to happen?
3734203,eng,Tom and Mary took turns taking the dog for a walk.
7407095,eng,They took their shoes and socks off.
2033802,eng,I don't want to tell Tom I've been to Boston.
6251658,eng,I don't want to waste time arguing.
6423636,eng,I told Mary that she should do that.
5096322,eng,"Though it was in my power not to die for you, but to get as husband whom I would of the Thessalians."
7840661,eng,Every student should thank their teacher.
4699919,eng,She looked glamorous.
7194520,eng,Didn't you know Tom was in Australia?
6235684,eng,Tom is the only one who didn't volunteer to help.
8641412,eng,Students can attend virtual classes.
5434713,eng,Tom died from his wounds.
6268304,eng,I did that in three hours.
4410147,eng,The children will be happy.
7502329,eng,I doubt that Tom will be as careless the next time he does that.
3204922,eng,Sometimes maybe it's better not to tell the truth.
8416138,eng,Tom used to stutter.
10336171,eng,"The checkerboard with 100 squares used in checkers has its black squares numbered 1 to 50, from right to left, on the black side, so that they initially occupy the four rows of squares identified by the numbers 1 to 20, while the white pieces stand on the four rows of squares identified by the numbers 31 to 50."
43350,eng,The old man had a noble countenance.
2642725,eng,Tom and Mary are expecting you.
5674718,eng,I can't see a freaking thing!
6505154,eng,Tom and Mary said they wouldn't do anything about it.
1873595,eng,Dad went to the bank because he was short of money.
8003764,eng,Mennad can call his friends.
9810094,eng,I hope Tom serves time for the crimes he's committed.
8469957,eng,Are Tom and Mary coming to the party?
6409752,eng,Mary is better at speaking French than you think she is.
6480107,eng,Do you know what I think?
2271717,eng,I didn't fall asleep.
6875964,eng,You've been making too many mistakes.
9447755,eng,"When I insert my keys into the lock, I can hear my dog jumping towards the door."
2643512,eng,Tom took the keys from Mary.
8956522,eng,We had no choice except to put up with the noise.
7271366,eng,Sami never made eye contact with Layla.
6267037,eng,Tom thinks Mary doesn't have to do that.
10217568,eng,Ziri almost kissed Rima.
2545909,eng,I'm sorry you got fired.
5640471,eng,I wasn't sure what it was.
10091510,eng,Why are you looking so pensive today?
6074221,eng,Children grow up so fast.
6517242,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary are blind.
9455614,eng,Tom pointed a finger at me.
3134450,eng,"In Victorian age, women were considered ""Angels of the hearth""."
6337141,eng,I wonder whether this is some sort of scam.
1185350,eng,Lucy looked after my dog.
6231456,eng,We should've expected something like this to happen.
3914416,eng,They're interrogating her.
7150310,eng,Tom was in Australia at the time.
7966920,eng,Are wasps insects?
7408006,eng,They often bring their work home.
2539311,eng,Would you please quit asking me that?
8301641,eng,He moved into an upscale suburb in Budapest.
280165,eng,We studied the Concordance to Shakespeare to accumulate examples of alliteration.
8475504,eng,He moved.
9407442,eng,What's nanotechnology?
6575323,eng,Sami shut off the air conditioning.
9598703,eng,What is the best way to get to Lisbon?
3904045,eng,You can't compete with her.
2885759,eng,For how many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
5871670,eng,Sami was working for a credit card company.
329421,eng,"Hrmmm, to judge from their looks they might be from Shanghai."
3723599,eng,It's the price we pay for love.
276389,eng,I wish someone would help me with English composition.
6270936,eng,I didn't break anything.
8850342,eng,"This forced her to consider an uncomfortable possibility -- that maybe her father and his music were, in fact, cool."
66410,eng,You should get the job for which you are best fitted.
1954851,eng,Tom can't see us.
4755595,eng,Tell Tom that I'm ready.
645471,eng,I will arrive on 23rd of May.
6522555,eng,Tom and Mary buttered their toast.
23012,eng,We communicate by means of language.
287961,eng,He is proud of having been educated in the United States.
503830,eng,Lack of sleep is bad for your health.
2255259,eng,You were cheating.
6815098,eng,Everybody here knows you don't eat pork.
7739026,eng,Sami won't be able to do it.
2239754,eng,Tom was clever.
7184013,eng,I have no doubt in my mind you're the woman I'm going to marry.
7113722,eng,I don't belong in jail.
8250297,eng,Tom did an ollie on his skateboard.
6996352,eng,Do you see a bear now?
7017934,eng,Tom forgot to pay the electric bill.
10525012,eng,Tom is throwing you a surprise party.
2639922,eng,You said almost all of your friends were Canadians.
30236,eng,"At last, we were home!"
798666,eng,He asked for my help.
6224885,eng,Tom lent me all the money he had on him.
10560162,eng,"Tom's a strange guy, isn't he? ""Well, it takes all kinds."""
776343,eng,Would you look after my cat?
8246510,eng,He snorts and chuckles at the sound of his own joke.
6030647,eng,Should we call an ambulance?
10467880,eng,He doesn't drink coffee in a glass.
7401771,eng,"He sent you here, didn't he?"
8572895,eng,Do you think Bouteflika left a lasting legacy that Algeria could be proud of?
10136734,eng,China is one of Algeria's most important partners.
6124145,eng,Tom talks to Mary every day.
59612,eng,This metal is comparable to iron in strength.
7194681,eng,I think that that's the reason Tom doesn't have any friends.
8292884,eng,His Berber is still pretty crappy.
2793118,eng,Red currants are smaller than strawberries.
8856301,eng,You are giving me less.
7388511,eng,He hasn't yet bought his ticket.
8210808,eng,I've been singing professionally since I was thirteen years old.
7288824,eng,Sami doesn't know Layla on a personal level.
2255381,eng,You'll need one.
51011,eng,What happened here?
2543049,eng,I'm afraid that's impossible.
4616096,eng,"Yaroslav the Ukrainian and I have discussed the concept of having one time zone for this whole world. He's like the ""Esperanto Man."""
8371804,eng,Tell me her name.
9956350,eng,Yanni starts his mornings like this.
6520475,eng,I hope Tom and Mary are punctual.
3918592,eng,It's definitely her.
3904645,eng,I didn't want them to worry.
2690649,eng,A clever salesman will always ask a matron if her mother is at home.
2395040,eng,"Tom wants to kill you, Mary."
301877,eng,He was wild with anger.
10207683,eng,Ziri had cash in his pocket.
804137,eng,"Eighteen minutes later, the battle was over."
4500999,eng,Your vote matters.
2996306,eng,There's someone at the door who wants to talk to you.
7402410,eng,She isn't as bad as she looks.
7246412,eng,Sami was nothing but disrespectful.
3172919,eng,Tom speaks French about as well as Mary does.
7379627,eng,Mary later died from her wounds.
6664901,eng,I'll try to stop Tom from doing that.
7386397,eng,He unlocked his suitcase.
5386309,eng,We won't be beholden to special interests.
5937224,eng,I can't imagine Tom had any enemies.
3618747,eng,I'm afraid this isn't a good time for me.
6694831,eng,"You already know about what Tom did, don't you?"
7544768,eng,Tom could see Mary sitting with John.
7258957,eng,Sami is coming home from school.
6841953,eng,Google it.
6812062,eng,I knew that Tom lied to us.
2618247,eng,They're changing the color of my dress.
4493643,eng,They have plenty of food.
268931,eng,"When you lack sleep, you are apt to be careless."
5858999,eng,I had to say that.
7278806,eng,Sami didn't want to dance with Layla.
10151240,eng,"That isn't what you're saying, I hope."
2546862,eng,You're a little early.
3568837,eng,Tom kissed Mary on the tip of her nose.
2770643,eng,I need all the help I can get.
7131012,eng,Tom has starred in several TV shows.
6099416,eng,Layla is responsible. Make no mistake about it.
3973192,eng,"Tom walked into the room, carrying a bouqet of flowers."
3185828,eng,Can Tom pay for all this?
6264552,eng,Tom should've bought some flowers for Mary.
7381320,eng,Mary said she felt rejected.
8321595,eng,Let's go back to my place.
5478188,eng,You're not telling me the truth.
2089382,eng,I like this music.
7402020,eng,He said that he didn't swim.
6260879,eng,I know why you went to Boston.
268055,eng,The boy entered by the back door.
8801841,eng,They started without me.
434864,eng,He cut his finger with the knife.
7519136,eng,Everyone knows that Tom can't win.
2436260,eng,Who did Tom bring with him?
6136374,eng,Tom hopes that someday he'll be able to play the drums as well as Mary does.
8108236,eng,"He forced me to dig my father's grave and, on top of that, he stole the pick."
8271779,eng,I don't have transport.
7156075,eng,Tom never went to Australia.
3932996,eng,Linda made false claims of pregnancy to force Dan to marry her.
9269060,eng,I put on some makeup.
8527839,eng,"He's making dinner, isn't he?"
3416758,eng,"Tom is winning, isn't he?"
250535,eng,My house is a mortgage-free house.
6411726,eng,Mary couldn't attend the party because she was sick.
6226991,eng,I'm sure Tom wouldn't be mad at Mary if there weren't a good reason to be.
1793521,eng,"Where there's a ravine, there's a Cossack."
903852,eng,I think it's time for me to make some new friends.
6058476,eng,"The salt shaker is empty. ""Did you fill it with salt?"" ""Yes, to the edge."""
6409570,eng,Mary usually wears sunglasses whenever she goes outside.
6343972,eng,I'd better wait until Tom gets here.
1501430,eng,Parents often sacrifice themselves to ensure that their children receive a good education.
7793767,eng,I've decided not to support the plan.
7325581,eng,Sami wanted Layla to stop wearing the hijab.
6234208,eng,You're the only one who was supposed to do that.
30361,eng,"With more courage, I might have proposed to Mary."
5218649,eng,I thanked Tom for the tip.
10538160,eng,The boat Tom was on capsized.
2891213,eng,Give Tom some room.
6711532,eng,Sami is the exact opposite of Layla.
2537946,eng,Tom has a wife and a three-year-old daughter.
3924453,eng,Tom was reconciled to his situation and tried to make the best of it.
3403237,eng,It could take weeks.
6503490,eng,Tom and Mary don't know why the picnic was canceled.
8187530,eng,Tom fell deeper and deeper into debt.
2826705,eng,"How come you ate the cucumber, you dimwit? You knew that I wanted to make a cucumber mask!"
5357288,eng,I don't think we're alone.
1462559,eng,You have already been to Berlin.
3075168,eng,Tom held the canteen of water to Mary's lips.
7405017,eng,She says that she'll win.
6575954,eng,"Sami's backpack, containing his wallet, was found in the marsh."
9970445,eng,Yanni needs to give his windshield a wipe.
5738550,eng,We're in for a tough ride.
7978347,eng,Sami got kicked out of the club.
9674663,eng,I'm still not finished reading the book.
3619748,eng,Tom sometimes goes to Boston on business.
8001603,eng,"And they covered the whole face of the earth, wasting all things. And the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever were on the trees, which the hail had left; and there remained not any thing that was green on the trees, or in the herbs of the earth, in all Egypt."
314407,eng,She is three years older than I am.
2544577,eng,Tom is flirting with Mary.
7503577,eng,I knew that Tom would probably be happy to do that for you.
61501,eng,Please bring this gentleman a glass of beer.
2237651,eng,Tom saw her.
2556571,eng,It's easy and fun.
7110478,eng,Tom knew Mary couldn't have children.
10751374,eng,Tom got trapped underneath his car.
9202862,eng,You should go to bed now.
6125093,eng,Tom realized he barely had enough money to buy everything he had to buy.
60295,eng,Let's get this proposal down in black and white before we submit it to the boss.
2793126,eng,Do you want to add avocado to the salad?
1676590,eng,They robbed me blind.
247184,eng,It was easy for us to find Jane.
10097531,eng,"I think Tom's a bit tipsy. ""A bit tipsy? He just threw up on Mary!"""
7108774,eng,Tom's suitcase is too heavy for him to carry.
7194382,eng,Everyone knew Tom didn't like living in Australia.
3725181,eng,I thought you said you weren't attracted to Tom.
4752778,eng,I'm cutting up an onion.
10207537,eng,"I need one container of eggs, you see."
2249501,eng,Keep looking around.
436589,eng,I feel seasick.
6352701,eng,Can you still do a handstand?
6234102,eng,Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that by myself.
3353716,eng,"I got married at 30 and, at the same time, I started getting infertility treatment."
8952412,eng,Tom is the bridegroom.
8585937,eng,All the girls laughed at me.
507750,eng,He's considered to be one of the greatest scientists in the world.
7400858,eng,She said that she wasn't upset.
306083,eng,Each of them has to write a report about what he saw.
7400227,eng,"He isn't as old as you, is he?"
6257470,eng,Tom would be fined if he did that.
10520303,eng,What was originally a temporary measure became a permanent fixture.
6646553,eng,Tom told me he's interested.
6354661,eng,Tom wouldn't let me sing.
8422054,eng,Don't tell me again.
8054903,eng,Mennad started to smell a strange smell.
10621222,eng,"Tom went into the staffroom, even though pupils weren't allowed to do so."
3258930,eng,You have a sore throat and fever. Don't go out.
5732873,eng,It gave me great satisfaction.
316960,eng,She smiled at the sight of her mother.
10671768,eng,"I read the dissertation ""The Sociophonetics and Phonology of the Cavite Chabacano Vowel System."""
8047652,eng,Some of the nicest people I know are Canadians.
246745,eng,She had already gone to bed when I phoned her at 11:00 p.m.
8923360,eng,I lost my left glove somewhere.
731880,eng,How many times have you gone?
10350406,eng,I've completely forgotten its name.
9770720,eng,Yanni literally showed no emotion.
8401409,eng,Tom was eavesdropping.
10137382,eng,Where is the student's book?
2422288,eng,The sunglasses made him look like an undercover policeman.
10720942,eng,Tom didn't tell us where he'd parked his car.
6518205,eng,Tom and Mary excused themselves and left.
4016101,eng,Where's your other earring?
40489,eng,The tarantula seized its victim very quickly.
8050314,eng,Mennad and Baya don't care.
7191646,eng,Sami's dishwasher is broken.
3273560,eng,He has just finished his studies. He's looking for a job.
6351176,eng,We know Tom did that.
7379504,eng,Mary said she was in Boston now.
802749,eng,They said use of force should be used only as a last choice.
300598,eng,He has collected twice as many stamps as I have.
7472201,eng,Tom and Mary reconsidered their decision.
8808820,eng,Haven't you seen this musical?
6524237,eng,I wonder whether Tom is finished or not.
7182145,eng,Tom said that he suspected that Mary was very eager to do that.
2739294,eng,Tom sighed. A lot of things had happened to him recently.
8936468,eng,I'll take care of the garden.
7407034,eng,They went shopping with their families.
6411621,eng,Mary looked around to see if she was being followed.
4040334,eng,"As luck would have it, Providence was on my side."
6646845,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6571917,eng,Sami viewed Farid as his leader.
10231725,eng,This is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.
7138039,eng,Sami is ready now.
2096085,eng,You don't look like a millionaire.
1223056,eng,A Mr. West called while you were out.
3392624,eng,Let's not bother Tom with this.
7386147,eng,She slept with her shoes on.
9741519,eng,"Aha, there you are!"
8477244,eng,He'll go home.
1093312,eng,Tom lay awake for a long time wondering about what he should do.
8614543,eng,He needs to talk to her.
9457053,eng,Tom is shutting the door.
5290864,eng,Which is the most suitable manure for the tomatoes?
2229580,eng,I'm sick of your stupid remarks.
9194164,eng,Tom might be leaving soon.
8979545,eng,Did you tell it to your brother?
6666546,eng,I don't think we'll win.
17566,eng,"You play the guitar quite like a professional, don't you?"
6408407,eng,Mary said she thought she knew what had caused the accident.
3260338,eng,Turn the corner and you will see the stadium.
5736140,eng,What could turn this around?
3083499,eng,Tom looks pretty drunk.
2473506,eng,He cheated on my mother.
8183777,eng,I asked Tom why he thought that Mary wouldn't be at school today.
1577215,eng,A new classroom building was built in our institute last year.
7441165,eng,"Tom and Mary aren't fast enough, are they?"
8946961,eng,"You're a beginner, but you learn quickly."
10613869,eng,The salesman weighs the cheese on a copper scale.
61506,eng,This is better by far.
1561368,eng,They are here.
6044025,eng,Layla and Sami began to fight bitterly.
7736104,eng,I didn't want Tom to know the truth.
10163105,eng,This hotel was built three years ago.
7520553,eng,I know Tom isn't a hockey fan.
5740700,eng,It's going to get tougher.
2158319,eng,What you know cannot hurt you.
10787217,eng,They were taken by surprise.
6196789,eng,Was the notebook blue?
5788644,eng,Tom didn't want to go back to jail.
9668417,eng,Esperanto is a living language ideal for international communication.
5853209,eng,I left Tom alone.
7409433,eng,They got the jobs they wanted.
3754431,eng,"No one is born wise, but many die stupid."
7252341,eng,Sami used to go to the grocery store every single night.
49853,eng,The musical was far from being a success.
8375828,eng,That impostor called himself a doctor.
4506164,eng,Mary plays basketball well.
10022257,eng,Be brief and to the point.
10365273,eng,We listened in disbelief.
9189380,eng,Where are you going so early?
8303970,eng,“One dollar store” is my favorite store.
16427,eng,Are you planning on staying long in Berlin?
1027713,eng,Tom wouldn't be happy living with Mary.
2185517,eng,Make him work for it.
2025934,eng,Tom wants a progress report right now.
8396421,eng,His girlfriend is breathtaking.
6513445,eng,Why do Tom and Mary need to do that now?
7123158,eng,Tom could order you to do that.
8196772,eng,Can I know her name?
9409499,eng,Yanni isn't religious.
8581562,eng,Tom left in a cab.
10480572,eng,Are they Romans?
7429613,eng,"If I don't do that, someone else will have to do it."
4663668,eng,Call me immediately if anything happens.
10127164,eng,Tom went to the science museum.
8147090,eng,Berber survives in many pockets of North Africa.
44249,eng,There were two hundred people in the room.
4999942,eng,I'm actually shocked.
7229582,eng,Sami doesn't want to smoke weed.
6496443,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't want to help John do that again.
59300,eng,I assume that this idea will work well.
2273263,eng,Tom is leaving me.
6269764,eng,Tom won't likely be absent.
8607964,eng,The 1793 Yellow Fever outbreak prompted the building of America's first quarantine station and hospital at the port of Philadelphia — established to try to keep contagions at bay.
6413021,eng,I told Mary I wanted her to teach me how to drive.
6717144,eng,Sami was supposed to know that.
3839943,eng,All that read this are foolish.
786724,eng,Who says sentences have to be serious?
7539655,eng,I told Tom why I'd never graduated from high school.
8032788,eng,Mennad was in a very serious relationship.
2330018,eng,I guess I always knew there was a chance that Tom wouldn't come.
693619,eng,Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
34042,eng,Heavy sound is being looked for.
9104774,eng,"Have some more chicken. ""No, thanks."" ""Are you full?"" ""Yes."""
65935,eng,"The dog barked furiously, which awakened my brother."
5112602,eng,The father of this president was also a president.
3605510,eng,It would be better if we didn't change our plans.
8506429,eng,I'm not much younger than you are.
6665962,eng,I almost agreed to do that.
6505105,eng,I didn't think Tom and Mary were ready to do that.
2476735,eng,Did you hear anything unusual lately?
8078593,eng,Tom hired a hitman to kill Mary.
323516,eng,Thank you for coming in for the interview.
2769038,eng,Almost all German universities are public.
1801639,eng,She married a local boy.
6271922,eng,Tom says he's interested.
7283195,eng,"It was you that wanted it, so don't complain now."
304740,eng,He stood with his feet apart.
6078544,eng,Do you think it's really important?
6134961,eng,Sami was still at work.
2955494,eng,Tom advised Mary to stop drinking.
10580974,eng,"As customary on Christmas Day, Pope Francis appeared at the balcony of Saint Peter’s Basilica overlooking the square to deliver his “Urbi et Orbi” message and blessing to the city and to the world."
6126354,eng,Who made this guitar? Do you know?
33677,eng,There were a fair number of people in the hall.
6428404,eng,Tell Mary to take her time.
282164,eng,Aged people like to keep the world the way it is. On the other hand young people love to change the world.
6220526,eng,Tom and I love our kids.
7748844,eng,The claim that the Kabyle flag represents Kabylie is a flagrant lie.
783492,eng,"No matter if black, brown, yellow or normal, all people should have the same rights."
238345,eng,The police were suspicious of his movements.
6776193,eng,Tom had a lightbulb moment.
4494868,eng,The traffic was bad.
6015175,eng,They hate your freedoms.
6570614,eng,Tom put Mary's present in a bag with cute pictures of penguins on it.
6492779,eng,Tom and Mary said they would've done that if they'd thought it was necessary.
3736383,eng,It seemed pretty quiet.
10019102,eng,Do you know why Tom has hung a flag out of his window today?
2700857,eng,"You can eat up all you've got, but not tell all you know."
7378815,eng,Mary said that her job was tough.
8378918,eng,Algeria suffered from a massive devaluation.
6493816,eng,"I think Tom and Mary want to do that, even though they say they don't."
2882751,eng,Be nice and cook for your friend.
6427930,eng,Mary admitted she was afraid.
1731553,eng,You want to go out for a drink?
6493590,eng,Tom and Mary called to ask if there was anything they could do to help.
6518530,eng,Tom and Mary will do that for free.
8536248,eng,"She won't do that by herself, will he?"
6718755,eng,She ignored me for a year.
4498870,eng,Crime has gotten worse.
3150589,eng,Tom didn't buy anything.
7111414,eng,I don't think Tom is stoned.
3524873,eng,People usually die if you kill them.
309675,eng,She has a sharp nose.
8054397,eng,Mennad and Baya aren't fat.
6664511,eng,Tom got drowsy after lunch.
8316003,eng,Please come the day after tomorrow.
6249083,eng,"Tom is your younger brother, isn't he?"
8955705,eng,Maybe it was her?
9587996,eng,I decided to enroll.
7434425,eng,How warm is it?
7737833,eng,I can't be with Tom all day.
7245978,eng,The jackal is full of mischief.
9975555,eng,The windshield crack is fixed.
6463051,eng,Co-workers were convinced that Sami and Layla were having an affair.
8495881,eng,He traveled to Algeria on a renewed diplomatic passport.
6428725,eng,Mary deserved what she got.
8763864,eng,This lies outside my area of expertise.
8035439,eng,Women didn't use to be allowed to do that.
7386786,eng,He's taking his final exam.
2264168,eng,Can you come this afternoon or tomorrow afternoon?
36293,eng,"Above all, you must work now."
52717,eng,John can't play the guitar.
10094445,eng,"When Bouteflika came to power, Algeria had just ended a civil war."
6437051,eng,Tom is going to be back home soon.
6335143,eng,Tom said he's not planning to go.
6511901,eng,Tom and Mary have to finish what they're doing.
3417568,eng,Tom has left already.
6665776,eng,I can't remember the last time I ate dinner with Tom.
6869085,eng,You should have stayed where you belonged.
8834022,eng,I know how Tom did it.
5290531,eng,"I could've done better, I think."
9468072,eng,You may have as many as you want.
8519086,eng,She didn't want to work for him.
8264127,eng,We'll talk about that in class tomorrow.
6428992,eng,"Mary is greedy, isn't she?"
29848,eng,The lion ate the rabbit in one bite.
8071279,eng,I wanted to be last.
3413321,eng,Tom isn't naughty.
3907175,eng,I can't lie to him.
273474,eng,The ship cut her way through the waves.
7407359,eng,They left their sunglasses in their car.
10733115,eng,Are you sure you want to go to Australia?
5491094,eng,Tom has been a big help.
305009,eng,I spoke slowly so that they might understand me.
4016916,eng,"Tom would often sit alone on the porch, reading a book."
1155877,eng,I can't keep up with you. Could you dictate a bit slower?
6652378,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary would be willing to do that.
9970516,eng,Yanni doesn't have enough resin to fix all these windshield chips.
6530368,eng,I don't want to catch your cold.
7213051,eng,I'd consider doing that.
279841,eng,The Tomei Expressway connects Tokyo with Nagoya.
7469967,eng,Tom pushed the book away.
4547594,eng,How do I tell my parents that I’m pregnant?
2030002,eng,Are you sure you don't want to wait for Tom?
6654417,eng,Tom said that he didn't want me to help him.
7822630,eng,The tool enables us to work.
237665,eng,You're taking on the company style.
6782069,eng,I should thank them.
8589078,eng,Algeria is changing rapidly.
10193124,eng,It was polynomial long division in Maths today. I didn't get any of it.
6228538,eng,Didn't you know Tom was rich?
8880610,eng,"I heard that Tom committed suicide, but I didn't believe it."
8891741,eng,That's how I learned English.
3826615,eng,We don't miss anything.
5353387,eng,Try harder tomorrow.
4311224,eng,The sauce got burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pan.
10217619,eng,Ziri already knows who stole his motorbike.
8534394,eng,I enjoy the work that they do.
6918920,eng,"Tom and Mary went to see ""Environmental Noise"" live in concert. It was just a jackhammer and some angst-ridden crows."
5758108,eng,The driver is OK.
36964,eng,Drivers must look out for children crossing the road.
2693982,eng,"I'm sorry, but people I don't know can't come in."
10782502,eng,I need to clean up a bit here.
8515185,eng,He says he agrees with her.
2804269,eng,This plant is a hybrid.
7235879,eng,I don't think that I can explain the difference.
297052,eng,He has more experience on the job than I.
5936587,eng,"Tom tried to speak to Mary, but he couldn't."
9338769,eng,That's basically it.
7035452,eng,This is my music teacher.
294688,eng,He has received a commission as a naval officer.
3531539,eng,I will attend the party only if Mary will not.
70484,eng,"It won't be your fault if your son does anything wrong: he is twenty-five now, isn't he?"
1742796,eng,Mary hasn't listened to the speech yet.
8516004,eng,He claims he doesn't know anything about her.
6003273,eng,He can speak Spanish.
8407045,eng,I really enjoyed my French classes in high school.
6567438,eng,Tom wore a thick scarf.
2674756,eng,"And then came creeping over her face and eyes flies without wings; she winked and blinked, but they could not fly away, for their wings had been pulled off; this, added to the hunger she felt, was horrible torture."
7397810,eng,He hasn't said what he might do.
9146306,eng,We have news.
6867870,eng,Tom will stay with us all summer.
1029898,eng,Tom and Mary are on the same wavelength.
7434914,eng,Sami prayed salatul tasbih.
7388187,eng,She's admitted her guilt.
9435375,eng,Have I ever told you about the time Tom went to Boston?
7279111,eng,Sami had his backpack in his hand.
6496997,eng,Tom and Mary said they don't want John to ever do that again.
7973638,eng,Why are you looking for them?
5769783,eng,I am from South America.
3023142,eng,"You don't want to go to Boston, do you?"
5744317,eng,We can't beat the system.
7444081,eng,They told me that they're afraid to do that.
2724658,eng,I'll give you a lesson that you'll remember for a long time.
6507483,eng,Tom and Mary said they don't want to do that again.
2921999,eng,"I could hardly make out half of what she'd said, she was hurrying to share the obtained information. I had to listen twice."
8516446,eng,"He just sat there, staring at her."
1877233,eng,School is not a waste of time.
6094399,eng,Aren't you going to walk?
3663455,eng,I never go on vacation without my cellphone.
7990049,eng,Sami is following Layla on Instagram.
2777305,eng,I am really lazy.
9721798,eng,Yanni is a researcher on Algeria.
8367645,eng,Tom got killed by a hired assassin.
7852001,eng,Arguing with the separatists is like arguing with a cheap prostitute on the street.
3527329,eng,Tom's tone was a bit aggressive.
8373787,eng,I've been speaking to your director and he agreed.
3928103,eng,Tom left the group and was never seen again.
5752492,eng,Mistakes will happen.
6678218,eng,"If I'd known that you were sick, I could've visited you in the hospital."
4308195,eng,I'm not a child anymore.
10471432,eng,Squirrels help plant trees.
3822104,eng,Tom will give you what you need.
9074069,eng,Yanni has always wanted to learn Berber.
6648911,eng,Tom said that he thought it would be raining on Monday.
6234753,eng,Tom told us that it wouldn't necessary to do that.
6267872,eng,I plan on studying French.
8080390,eng,Go feed the chickens.
8522104,eng,She hired someone to kill him.
7212680,eng,It seems obvious Tom is unable to swim.
1724553,eng,This means that you will never see a biography about me.
6265009,eng,Tom is working at a restaurant.
293071,eng,They made him do the work again.
322601,eng,"If we should miss the train, we'll go by bus."
6232197,eng,Let me show you this new hammer that I just bought.
10146301,eng,What kind of problems does Tom have?
3839962,eng,They are there.
6849045,eng,That helped us a lot.
7354911,eng,It's a polite way of saying no.
2252657,eng,There's no escape.
4529793,eng,Tom was arrested last month.
305245,eng,No one gave up hope.
7237689,eng,Sami caught Layla and Salima smashing.
298648,eng,He is proud of his family.
6806659,eng,Sami has two friends: Farid and Salim.
7511891,eng,I didn't know that your uncle lived with you.
277290,eng,A shameless liar speaks smilingly.
8197734,eng,How many states are there in your country?
6910249,eng,What do they call this?
10655730,eng,She pretended not to care.
8038418,eng,Very few people do this.
6274741,eng,Tom is almost deaf.
8588831,eng,"At some point, we just need to make a decision."
5077304,eng,We're having a great time.
2358557,eng,"No one is perfect, who does not desire to be more perfect."
3825342,eng,Why aren't you cooking dinner?
852920,eng,She is beautiful like her mother.
10712186,eng,Tom can do wheelies.
257663,eng,I haven't seen him lately.
4144777,eng,He's semicute.
10247763,eng,Write your name and phone number on the list.
7176454,eng,Tom knows that he's partly to blame.
6415080,eng,Was it you who told Mary she ought to do that?
6706226,eng,I'm not going to start doing that.
3635911,eng,It's kind of chilly in here.
7518740,eng,Nobody knows that we're cousins.
2111432,eng,That's illegal.
6124700,eng,The only girl Tom likes is Mary.
6124512,eng,I'm waiting for Tom to help me.
6311220,eng,Who are those girls?
9382791,eng,"Mary is a woman, not a girl."
4895469,eng,Learn from Comrade Lei Feng.
5746942,eng,Does it ever bother you?
4014679,eng,It's actually harder than it looks.
961990,eng,Peter wanted to become a doctor.
10520055,eng,Economists say the impact of a fourth wave of the coronavirus on household budgets is going to be significant.

9634830,eng,A lot can change in a year.
6972435,eng,I would not put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains.
6676844,eng,This car isn't mine.
10222171,eng,Ziri found this at the mall.
3272065,eng,They should cost about €100.
2013531,eng,I don't want to look younger.
9777951,eng,"To start with, it's too expensive."
4727302,eng,He knew that life would never be the same again.
5976573,eng,Tom wasn't punished for what he did.
312216,eng,She hasn't come here yet. I am afraid she may have lost her way.
9932404,eng,Tom is a law-abiding gun owner.
5850790,eng,I chose to wait.
255974,eng,I don't like walking home alone after dark.
6871171,eng,Tom would have loved this.
10110107,eng,Yanni and Rima are just friends.
9842802,eng,Germans are punctual.
6243044,eng,I think Tom will likely do that later.
6108415,eng,"If you ever plan to do that again, let me know."
7410114,eng,They confessed that they were afraid.
4495542,eng,Tom agreed to do that.
2762756,eng,The shortest comments are often the most useful ones.
10333542,eng,She was concerned about his prolonged absence.
10611666,eng,They always talk smack about me behind my back.
287446,eng,I relieved him of his burden.
7338238,eng,Sami stopped focusing on his classes.
1739440,eng,I can teach you how to hunt.
999029,eng,Look what she brought me for my birthday!
5747255,eng,Did Tom change his story?
7156021,eng,Tom plans to go back to Australia.
6264033,eng,Tom is still determined to do that for Mary.
7772726,eng,It's not worth keeping up with fashion.
291902,eng,He hid it behind the door.
6657181,eng,This is a picture of the train that we were on.
887124,eng,She forgot that she bought him a present.
944560,eng,I just barely managed to pass the test.
6009232,eng,It is a bad translation.
5352885,eng,Tom is courageous and fearless.
7791614,eng,I can't leave the house until I put on some makeup.
8400926,eng,I think we're going to Algeria.
6707083,eng,Speak more quietly.
939857,eng,You're wanted on the telephone.
39296,eng,But I can't understand them very well.
6498968,eng,Tom and Mary called the office to say that they'd be late.
5150307,eng,The book that I bought on the internet hasn't been delivered to me yet.
5879552,eng,It was homecoming weekend.
7541910,eng,Tom retired and moved to Boston in 2013.
42456,eng,That's putting it mildly.
5586434,eng,He is assiduous in reading as many Russian books as possible.
8402214,eng,I know someone shot me.
1094231,eng,Tom dozed off during the meeting.
21562,eng,A poor school record will count against you when you look for a job.
10585943,eng,"The full name for the Korean alphabet means ""the right letters for instructing the people""."
6507381,eng,Do you really think Tom and Mary are in Boston?
807110,eng,The violence lasted three days.
1660835,eng,Tom writes slowly.
6231598,eng,Tom thought he might be permitted to do that by himself.
1934741,eng,I've been trying to decode this message.
1344647,eng,Kyoto is the most beautiful in the autumn.
3368205,eng,What did you decide to do?

4162060,eng,He ate bread with sour cream and cheese.
3858754,eng,"A triangle has three angles, and a hexagon has six angles."
7376451,eng,Mary likes to do things her own way.
3419562,eng,The performance by the young violinist was awesome.
7316634,eng,Tom isn't as stubborn as Mary.
1799695,eng,We got separated.
3005821,eng,"You are blessed, oh Lord our God and God of our ancestors, God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob, God of Sarah, God of Rebecca, God of Rachel and God of Leah."
6551469,eng,Mars lost its global magnetic field billions of years ago and now just has remnant “fossil” magnetic fields embedded in certain regions of its surface.
7119553,eng,Don't fear them.
7544030,eng,Tom is a very good cartoonist.
7964962,eng,I wish I had a car I could depend on.
6527523,eng,Tom said that he wasn't hesitant to do that.
3699753,eng,The message was deleted.
40272,eng,Cheese doesn't digest easily.
9083404,eng,They've washed your dog.
3204910,eng,What can you tell us about yesterday's earthquake?
7384713,eng,He checked his pockets.
5205849,eng,I hope to see you tomorrow.
2275944,eng,I didn't think you'd mind.
2408492,eng,I think we're done here.
10614256,eng,"I remember in art class in elementary school, we were made to wear smocks so our clothes wouldn't get splattered with paint."
6340549,eng,Why don't you ask Tom what he plans to do?
8878585,eng,You can't escape from your wrongdoing. Reputation lies in the tongue.
265477,eng,Why don't you give me a ride?
1631877,eng,Mr. Straddle called me aside.
1230443,eng,How long will the train stop here?
6234619,eng,I stayed indoors all day because it was raining.
9270922,eng,Tom went to buy tickets.
3008588,eng,I am my own biggest critic.
17238,eng,I can make nothing of what you do or say.
7375222,eng,Mary told me that she was doing that.
10544164,eng,You're so lucky to live here!
1893882,eng,We don't have that much time.
6500790,eng,Do we have time to finish this before Tom and Mary get here?
33341,eng,Almost all the students enjoy their school life.
10317516,eng,Can I have the key?
6785896,eng,I've already finished reading the book that Tom gave me yesterday.
2304530,eng,An image is worth a thousand words.
8951016,eng,Tom's father has just died.
3665218,eng,I want to eat something sweet.
6499663,eng,I think Tom and Mary aren't going to stop doing that anytime soon.
10721052,eng,Did he go to your school?
8477377,eng,He's careless.
10284723,eng,"When you were studying abroad in Japan, did you make many friends?"
1652184,eng,Keep your eye on him.
328872,eng,Young Tanaka is the stupidest person in the department.
8589886,eng,We met in Algeria.
9960713,eng,Staff fear further redundancies.
10655765,eng,He was trying to deceive the wait by sipping a beer at the bar.
7236312,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary would be reluctant to do that by themselves.
2374133,eng,I just wasn't expecting this to happen.
44354,eng,The airplane landed at Narita Airport.
7964591,eng,Twelve of the soldiers were killed.
8806194,eng,Yanni gained a degree in Berber.
307773,eng,Cornering him in an argument is easy—like taking candy from a baby.
5216281,eng,I'm supposed to be in bed.
9859047,eng,It never occurred to me that Tom might not be feeling well.
2111893,eng,Drive faster.
2247460,eng,I was barefoot.
9640607,eng,I rarely sit in the front.
1025864,eng,Tom dyed his hair dark brown.
6392786,eng,We can't talk here. Let's go somewhere more private.
7131754,eng,Have you been told that lately?
9476523,eng,You're just one of many people having this issue.
10145932,eng,Tom doesn't have much free time on weekends.
5825759,eng,"Don't answer me back like that, Tom."
5789461,eng,"There's nothing wrong, I hope."
6353716,eng,Tom looks like he's amused.
73775,eng,"I do not regret having gone into the forest and up the mountain, replied the younger brother."
8023012,eng,She forgot to iron her Kabyle dress.
3553367,eng,Would domestic peace be plunged into jeopardy?
6349811,eng,I didn't know I'd be handcuffed.
5121231,eng,This clothing is dirty and needs to be washed.
10078322,eng,What's Algeria's primary source of fresh water?
5936422,eng,I've never been able to do it this quickly before.
4110998,eng,Interest rates have seesawed all year.
802691,eng,They did not protest working long hours for low pay.
10692979,eng,There was a note of command in Tom's voice.
8535624,eng,He chuckled to himself as he read his letter.
6419097,eng,Mary told me she didn't have any regrets.
6255954,eng,Tom says Mary doesn't believe John did that by himself.
4132556,eng,It's good that the sun came out.
6577625,eng,Sami became an Arabic teacher.
1064051,eng,She's not coming back.
462938,eng,The sunglasses cost twenty euros.
65932,eng,"In contrast to the dog, the cat has become domesticated only in recent times."
3920655,eng,I have a theory about him.
4890772,eng,We don't want your money.
9086257,eng,He's eating scrambled eggs for breakfast.
1822840,eng,"Even though English is his native language, Tom doesn't know the difference between ""tough"" and ""though""."
1689287,eng,"As I lost so much, I finally started to find myself."
6224524,eng,Tom won't ever get the chance to do that.
10065720,eng,Tom has schizoaffective disorder.
7185886,eng,I'm sorry that I haven't written to you in such a long time.
8993246,eng,Anyone who previously partied with the child sex trafficking-celebrity was tainted by association.
9361611,eng,Tom checked the king with his bishop.
7520295,eng,I know Tom could do that today.
7475552,eng,"They smiled at you, didn't they?"
60515,eng,How many persons does this hall hold?
9800570,eng,Yanni fell from grace.
3408886,eng,You know we don't need to do that.
3005387,eng,The water here is shallow.
3409437,eng,Tom couldn't finish his sandwich.
3583361,eng,"Hey, Tom, are you really dating Mary?"
10210522,eng,Ziri frowned.
9839813,eng,"I'm not Canadian, but my father is."
7396330,eng,She knows that she can count on us.
8512889,eng,I don't think Tom knows what that means.
7142885,eng,I think you shouldn't have followed Tom's advice.
10543080,eng,"In Yiddish ""khoshev,"" from Hebrew, is used for ""an important person,"" while ""vikhtik"" is used for ""an important thing."""
387419,eng,Do you know the difference between silver and tin?
1312790,eng,It's too early for you to come.
1072510,eng,Nothing acts as a better antidote for romance than young men and women doing geometry together at eight o'clock every morning.
10213819,eng,There is nothing Ziri can do.

1841737,eng,Can you hear us?
9992251,eng,Mary is a terrible stepmother.
1159478,eng,"Generally, men run faster than women."
7263891,eng,Sami and Layla knew the same people.
7381267,eng,Mary told me she was strict.
10791603,eng,Is Tom playing football?
462650,eng,The cigarette smoke annoyed the other passengers.
9422991,eng,I was outsmarted by Tom.
9687249,eng,Why didn't you close the door?
6111069,eng,I'd like to know how you did that.
10296654,eng,Ziri got really pushy.
316214,eng,She went on working till he called her.
10387923,eng,I always thought that I was older than you.
9241054,eng,I need a maid.
70348,eng,"Had it not been for your courage, we would have been killed."
7117344,eng,Tom must've been intrigued.
2673688,eng,Tomorrow morning we're leaving Japan.
10060097,eng,This Pokemon card is very valuable.
6232711,eng,"You know why I was supposed to do that, don't you?"
1668643,eng,She's sexually promiscuous.
9114342,eng,You have two options; beg or steal.
6071733,eng,I didn't know that Tom couldn't do that.
7475425,eng,They liked everything they heard.
2237333,eng,Tom looks uncertain.
254795,eng,I could not have done it.
7183746,eng,Tom is never going to admit he's wrong.
2498735,eng,"No, it's not right."
2255006,eng,You just rest.
4015446,eng,Who wouldn't be happy here?
8605011,eng,Algeria is taking big measures to save its economy.
3370321,eng,Tom threw a pillow at Mary and the pillow hit her squarely in the face.
2543604,eng,I'm getting ahead of myself.
8864870,eng,I fled to Australia to avoid getting arrested.
3703238,eng,He picked her at random.
760534,eng,She has not seen him for a long time.
3825611,eng,Let me use your computer.
7539598,eng,Tom asked Mary what she thought was going to happen.
924028,eng,Don't forget to answer his letter.
7514399,eng,Tom doesn't know that Mary can't do that.
4823532,eng,"The washing machine is on ""stop""."
10029932,eng,Tom didn't stop crying until his mother picked him up.
6418942,eng,I asked Mary if she wanted to go swimming.
3732544,eng,Tom seemed to understand everything you said.
10165490,eng,Jugurtha was executed in Rome.
9373491,eng,Don't let the kid play with the knife.
3918953,eng,I think you need to call him.
7386052,eng,She saw her name on the list.
7374952,eng,"Mary is pretty competitive, isn't she?"
6257617,eng,Tom usually gets what he asks for.

7141088,eng,Sami learned good work habits.
6221754,eng,No one I know wants to do that.
3155881,eng,Tom put on an apron.
4263038,eng,The fare you pay depends on the number of zones in which you travel.
6659297,eng,I'm the one who helped Tom find a place to live.
6815337,eng,He planted a tree.
7184425,eng,I don't like Australia that much.
259960,eng,I know he likes jazz music.
541180,eng,Why is a raven like a writing-desk?
1860176,eng,"The planning committee was commissioned to collect and analyze information. This will be the background for the definition of action, which will support the association to fulfill its mission."
6580858,eng,This is too salty.
9518556,eng,I hope that it isn't a problem.
10632962,eng,"Up to now, I've met him only once."
5272721,eng,You really are the chaff of humanity.
1741662,eng,Tell her that I am preparing dinner.
7466164,eng,My grandfather has no idea what the Berber language means.
58766,eng,I cannot look at this photo without being reminded of my school days.

57650,eng,This peach is a beauty.
5913409,eng,Sami has decided to become a translator.
9711848,eng,Tom wasn't the one who washed your car for you. It was Mary.
6873758,eng,Tom must have thought Mary was going to do that.
2549429,eng,We're all sorry.
10643066,eng,I'd like to report the theft of an car.
3737742,eng,What fun would that be?
3680808,eng,The lady's behaviour was always dignified.
6410475,eng,Mary said she thought doing that would be a good idea.
244050,eng,"At first I didn't like him, but I do now."
6222091,eng,Tom might not know how to do that.
6346123,eng,I wonder when Tom bought his car.
8797319,eng,Don't get lost once again.
9353077,eng,They stayed with their families.
455907,eng,I'm in the bathroom because I'm washing my hands.
7168637,eng,I think that Tom is going to resign.
10093529,eng,I will call back in 20 minutes.
6523736,eng,It's hard to believe that both Tom and Mary are still single.
6117900,eng,Maybe Tom will do that for Mary.
4498030,eng,Who did you offend?
2406066,eng,I saw an explosion.
6344590,eng,Are you still looking for a babysitter?
3370677,eng,Who else knows about this?
5251742,eng,I'm eating cereal.
6108220,eng,Do both Tom and Mary like to do that?
2538453,eng,Tom won't get very far without any money.
8592791,eng,Tom went to Boston to see his aunt.
9280324,eng,Did Tom say how he was going get to Boston?
3315849,eng,Tom asked me if I wanted to dance.
6489635,eng,He lived in central London.
4527267,eng,How cool is that!
2879567,eng,Give Tom the $300.
3162890,eng,Coral reefs are threatened by climate change.
10674992,eng,How many architects work in this office?

380806,eng,I gave her what little money I had with me.
1629928,eng,He's open-minded.
5754353,eng,The crowd was great.
3820182,eng,I love you for that.
2276110,eng,I don't like Tom either.
6510137,eng,Did you ask Tom and Mary why they didn't do that?
3916154,eng,How did you get him to say yes?
6241227,eng,Tom said he didn't want to do that anymore.
9188623,eng,Tom hit me a lot.
10216880,eng,"What are you doing here, Ziri?"
2954854,eng,You'd better do as Tom says.
290849,eng,He could not help undertaking the job.
6510533,eng,Tom and Mary say they can't prove John did that.
7156520,eng,Sami got tired.
7737189,eng,I did what I thought was right.
6964667,eng,Mary and Alice are sisters-in-law.
3931794,eng,It's a banner.
7286616,eng,Sami grabbed his phone and looked at it.
1026170,eng,Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
8787913,eng,Yanni and Nuja hurried over to Skura's house.
7441978,eng,Tom and Mary weren't wearing their new coats.
6340430,eng,Do you intend to eat that whole cake by yourself?
27834,eng,I paid in a lump sum when I bought a television set.
3724966,eng,We should not have angered Tom.
7732262,eng,Tom has been assigned to this group.
240548,eng,It's better not to prattle on about meaningless things. The more you open your mouth the more likely you are to put your foot in it.
8290350,eng,It's a good thing we got here early.
6337350,eng,I wonder if Tom is smiling now.
5922453,eng,Usefulness must be combined with pleasantness.
8399531,eng,He didn't like what he saw in the mosque.
2958489,eng,Tom was a prisoner of war for three years.
1453963,eng,There's got to be a way.
6910112,eng,Do you think your room is too small?
6728427,eng,I've got a headache all of the sudden.
6176177,eng,Chaos reigns in Mary's flat.
8535006,eng,She's from Boston and so is he.
7472580,eng,Tom and Mary cut it with their knives.
305125,eng,Their concert was a big hit.
10531099,eng,"Stress on the fragile human body in space may lead to the thinking that robots will be the way to go in space. Maybe, humanity's machine children will inherit spatial manifest destiny. Humans may be like goldfish in their fishbowl that is the Earth."
3919694,eng,Everyone looked at me.
3158783,eng,Tom was the only one who thanked me.
6659842,eng,I don't think Tom was depressed.
1096150,eng,"It'll take Tom some time, but eventually he'll get over Mary."
7399188,eng,He did all he could do to help.
1164478,eng,Tom just got married.
10114888,eng,Heroes don't do that.
10240314,eng,Did you really think you could Rickroll me just by sending me a link to the video?
6795255,eng,A sparrow built a nest in a tree.
3849996,eng,Samara Morgan never sleeps.
2985265,eng,Scientifical research often requires difficult compromises.
3489159,eng,"Tom has been lying through his teeth, hasn't he?"
10243601,eng,Ziri and Rima were super close.
55528,eng,This is too heavy a box for me to carry.
7334434,eng,Sami did that on Instagram.
5255776,eng,Tom seems to be happy and excited.
8416427,eng,Tom fixed my car.
2852032,eng,"The Hebrews are Israelis, since they come from Israel."
7941315,eng,What's the dollar rate today?
3445323,eng,That subject is not suitable for discussion.
10553321,eng,"Many Germans go on vacation to Italy, France, Greece, or Spain. I have done the same for almost twenty years."
8024734,eng,She has been traveling all over Kabylie.
3916337,eng,We'll get them to help you.
7476869,eng,This is all perfectly normal.
4902784,eng,The place is nearly empty.
6409195,eng,Mary told Tom he didn't want to eat spaghetti for dinner.
8007988,eng,Now his sack is on the table.
9050597,eng,The truth is that Tom and I don't really talk much.
8668657,eng,I'd love for you to have some of my lemonade.
2326548,eng,I forgave you a long time ago.
6240116,eng,Tom isn't likely to be charged with perjury.
10099833,eng,He was desperately unhappy.
9443976,eng,Tom brought the problem to our attention.
9664848,eng,Why did that happen to Tom?
5737098,eng,I'm anything but an elitist.
2145986,eng,Can I speak in English?
5913204,eng,"Sami's bicycle has been stolen, too."
8266084,eng,"To him, a new life in Algeria seemed like paradise."
6353254,eng,Tom's house is in the city.
6411446,eng,Mary says she believes she can take care of herself.
1938769,eng,I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
3909789,eng,No one's seen you in a while.
6337148,eng,I wonder whether there's really any possibility that Tom will do that.
7383173,eng,He helped himself to coffee.
3110353,eng,Tom will furnish you with anything you need.
6849150,eng,That's for us to decide.
4016274,eng,Why not just knock on the door?
5644393,eng,I looked at myself in the mirror.
2546909,eng,"We have a deal, right?"
6495733,eng,"I didn't think Tom and Mary would be cooperative, but they were."
3911729,eng,Take good care of them.
6091229,eng,Aren't you a singer?
3619201,eng,Tom took everything with him.
6423811,eng,Mary told Tom that she was curious.
3367335,eng,Who's Tom and how does he know me?
2247176,eng,Did you advise the suspect of his rights?
8584691,eng,Tom doesn't work for anyone.
7152538,eng,Tom thinks that Mary isn't in Australia now.
2537083,eng,Some people say that you shouldn't go swimming right after you eat.
6499921,eng,I think Tom and Mary share too much personal information online.
72915,eng,There used to be a bridge between two river banks.
6468710,eng,This restaurant specializes in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
2954790,eng,You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
6269329,eng,Tom has done so much for us.
10771846,eng,Rima put makeup on.
8052796,eng,Mennad paid for the bicycle.
5846205,eng,I plan to retire soon.
10673406,eng,"If you like astronomy, maybe read the article ""Nomadic Exoplanets and the NASA Strategic Vision for 2050."""
10372026,eng,Is it true that you're the one who did that?
2203891,eng,Who's watching?
2203200,eng,Tom is popular.
10225457,eng,Ziri kept his balls in the garage.
6211255,eng,Why are some people shy?
5752245,eng,We're all sick of it.
3921371,eng,We were just looking for Tom.
6512182,eng,Have Tom and Mary tried doing this before?
1302508,eng,Don't scream before you get injured.
8960737,eng,Why did you marry me?
7439173,eng,They said that they were appreciative.
6604371,eng,Tom surfed the large wave.
4863331,eng,I enjoyed her unexpected visit.
2124,eng,You should have refused such an unfair proposal.
7910777,eng,Viruses jump from host to host.
7443786,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were unbiased.
361579,eng,"I'm fed up with this winter, I want spring right now!"
2009282,eng,Do I remind you of the one of the guys you left behind?
5739382,eng,The vaccine has no effect.
9628582,eng,I'm usually the first one to get to work and the last to leave.
8838625,eng,Does Tom want you to try it?
52829,eng,No one seems to have any idea where John is.
7397432,eng,She said she should've left early.
5109568,eng,Tom ran away to Boston.
6648062,eng,Tom said that he wished he hadn't drunk that.
6010567,eng,Their nibling lives in the Netherlands.
9418753,eng,Tom quarrels with everybody.
6796808,eng,We need to make a list of things we need to buy.
1818921,eng,They went to a fortune teller.
7437260,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were doing fine.
8730260,eng,My younger brother is a tireless pussy hunter.
6517510,eng,Are you sure their names are Tom and Mary?
5354666,eng,A year consists of three hundred and sixty-five days or three hundred and sixty-six days.
10104709,eng,She consulted a doctor.
1094003,eng,Tom goes along with whatever Mary says.
6806556,eng,I always had the feeling that Tom and Mary were hiding something.
6346771,eng,You looked like you were uncertain.
7864299,eng,I never watch Algerian political talk shows.
3594666,eng,I want you to know I'll never do that.
910001,eng,Many of the world's seven thousand or so languages are spoken only by handfuls of living people and are in danger of extinction.
5170084,eng,Old friends contacted me.
1025749,eng,Tom finished doing his homework before dinner.
7185447,eng,I'm not so sure that I like Mary as much as the first time that I saw her.
6707966,eng,Sami moved back upstairs.
3908316,eng,How much did you tell him?
6229750,eng,These are Tom's sunglasses.
8476603,eng,He's a rabbi.
7392457,eng,He told me that he got there first.
6071470,eng,Tom showed me some pictures of his family.
2835556,eng,We're supposed to meet Tom in thirty minutes.
1171097,eng,Getting involved in politics is getting involved in the issues of society.
6810153,eng,Sami has been there before.
9345409,eng,What's your favorite childhood memory?
239928,eng,The door remains closed.
1096277,eng,"After working all day, Tom was really tired."
3004744,eng,I'm not much of an athlete.
1507514,eng,"Although English is not his first language, he speaks it impeccably."
9859063,eng,How often do you change the air filter in your car?
2641209,eng,Did Tom say why Mary isn't here today?
316628,eng,She has no sense of the beautiful.
10181363,eng,Tom was in charge of drawing up the resolution.
7520517,eng,I know that Tom did that well.
2011527,eng,We want to meet Tom.
6269084,eng,I'm not having much luck.
3387214,eng,The members of these nomadic tribes were skilled archers and riders; they were able to attack and run away as fast as the wind.
1665952,eng,I am shouting at my kids.
8480893,eng,He isn't singing.
779147,eng,The server farm suffered extensive breakage after the earthquake.
6339527,eng,Tom told me he didn't need to use a wheelchair anymore.
6083734,eng,We're looking for a solution to the problem.
6174960,eng,I give it to him.
8349991,eng,Her father is bald.
3859810,eng,I think that we've crossed the point of no return.
1887644,eng,I saw what Tom did.
7515763,eng,I know that you're still angry with me.
8574763,eng,They practically fed him on music.
3818147,eng,Tom isn't as talented as you.
260600,eng,I tried to listen to him carefully.
7519334,eng,I know that Tom isn't a busy man.
58552,eng,I don't think that you did all this homework by yourself.
10529660,eng,I've told you a hundred times that I'm not going to that stupid party.
7407433,eng,They wanted to sell their car.
6251663,eng,Tom hasn't complained about that yet.
8987621,eng,The bus was driven by Tom.
3338391,eng,Who will be able to predict?
301184,eng,He is coarse in manner.
9240716,eng,Why did you agree to do this?
274661,eng,Is there life on other planets?
8529401,eng,"He's a really good coach, isn't he?"
7436523,eng,Tom and Mary said that they didn't intend to stay.
260606,eng,I'm going to ascertain the truth of his statement.
6563186,eng,Tom was up with the lark.
2240597,eng,We're in town.
18595,eng,"Poor as he is, he is generous."
6769492,eng,I've been sneezing all day.
2249852,eng,Roll the dice.
6866316,eng,I'm going to the supermarket to buy some eggs.
9281052,eng,Yanni refused to sleep on the floor.
3722325,eng,I've never wanted anything so much in my life.
3735585,eng,I wonder what Tom is planning to do next summer.
35647,eng,The party was held on May 22.
10476531,eng,It's quite surprising just how many dishes one can make out of potatoes.
9571834,eng,Arrogant people are too narcissistic.
8173931,eng,Fish where the fish are.
953149,eng,Can eating just vegetables help you lose weight?
7824765,eng,"And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other."
2054860,eng,Your persistence is not appreciated.
5821036,eng,There are roosters who believe that the sun rises because they have sung.
660409,eng,Did you talk to your wife?
31398,eng,Let's not argue anymore.
2093293,eng,You better not open your mouth.
5388892,eng,Backflips can be dangerous.
7321053,eng,Sami acted crazy.
7883414,eng,"He said therefore to Joseph: Seeing God hath shewn thee all that thou hast said, can I find one wiser and one like unto thee?"
8973409,eng,The house has been standing empty for a long time.
10622844,eng,Mom's cooking and Dad's gardening.
59989,eng,I mean to quit this company.
8638659,eng,Our cells often use the same machinery to do different jobs.
7853689,eng,"And when he agreed to her request, she took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband to wife."
2956209,eng,Tom came to school very late today.
5937468,eng,I should've gone there by myself.
5112031,eng,Tom finally persuaded Mary with these words.
6272519,eng,Tom wasn't very nervous.
1863,eng,"I was planning on going to the beach today, but then it started to rain."
7317975,eng,Sami wasn't recording.
452227,eng,Anyone can do it as long as they try.
7522690,eng,I don't know how much time it'll take.
2245763,eng,I felt cheated.
3920603,eng,I'm upset about him.
6779651,eng,"O son of Tydeus, bravest of the race, / why could not I have perished, too, that day / beneath thine arm, and breathed this soul away / far on the plains of Troy, where Hector brave / lay, pierced by fierce AEacide, where lay / giant Sarpedon, and swift Simois' wave / rolls heroes, helms and shields, whelmed in one watery grave?"
462656,eng,The coffee is nasty.
2871344,eng,The interns work in the basement and there are no windows.
6264800,eng,I hope to be back on Monday.
2718564,eng,You should've trusted me.
7127109,eng,Tom is a despicable human being.
7394822,eng,She may take all the time she needs.
309699,eng,Her husband is now living in Tokyo.
802594,eng,They risked their lives on the dangerous trip.

8514784,eng,She swore her undying love to him.
316466,eng,She had a happy time with them.
6663088,eng,Let's hang out together tomorrow.
8405514,eng,He really needs that.
10099679,eng,This vacuum sucks.
6272654,eng,Tom said he's desperate.
6240568,eng,I still go to Boston several times a year.
10627606,eng,Ziri was enjoying a soccer match.

7514071,eng,I know Tom can help Mary do that tomorrow.
5078224,eng,Tom was liked by everyone.
6436143,eng,What was Tom doing in Boston anyway?
2359010,eng,I have another meeting scheduled.
7512927,eng,Nobody knew Tom could speak French so well.
7249784,eng,How common is it to see kangaroos and koalas in Austria?
880478,eng,Do you speak Swedish?
291374,eng,He anticipated traveling abroad the next year.
10714040,eng,"Your ideas are completely different from mine, so there's no way we'll be able to reach an understanding."

6432954,eng,Tom is going to be here by the end of the week.
6415920,eng,Mary won't likely need to do that by herself.

6898789,eng,"You're very particular, aren't you?"
7773150,eng,I was told that Tom had moved to Australia.
7733842,eng,How did Tom's interview go?
2712706,eng,You're wearing your T-shirt inside out.
1567754,eng,"The teacher of the kindergarten told the pupils to respect, and cherish each other."
6664645,eng,"Tom has written a lot of books, but none of them have ever been published."
7136853,eng,I think that it's very obvious what'll happen.
6344994,eng,Tom wasn't told to do that by himself.
7473264,eng,They splashed cold water on their faces.
9381538,eng,Yanni's room was only lit by the TV.
10127680,eng,Don't deprive me of my instant gratification.
2760147,eng,I am happy the ointment the doctor has recommended really works.
5139016,eng,What needs to be discussed?
4599999,eng,It's music to my ears.
8047365,eng,My parents don't speak French with me anymore.
6607993,eng,I'm working. I'm not watching TV.
6056936,eng,The currently available evidence does not permit me to make such a claim.
9355615,eng,The blanket is soft.
8790725,eng,I didn't learn much I didn't already have experience with.
6330838,eng,Sami exploded.
6242612,eng,You were the one who told us to do that.
7259237,eng,Sami saw the bus coming.
6048453,eng,It looks like nobody else is here yet.
10667398,eng,Tom and Mary spent all afternoon talking to each other.
306540,eng,They are collecting information by casual methods.
6898038,eng,"You aren't the only one who knows how to do that, are you?"
621807,eng,She does not like sushi.
27203,eng,A tall tree projects its long shadow on the water.
6125001,eng,Tom realized he barely had enough time to do what he needed to do.
7184287,eng,"I didn't know that you were born in Australia, too."
6365146,eng,The baby is due any day now.
6265891,eng,Tom didn't think that Mary was having fun.

3241327,eng,Why do you want to go today?
284749,eng,I have not seen him in months.
1951519,eng,Tom can't do that.
1513746,eng,She pretended that she knew nothing about it.
10005250,eng,I used to ride my bike on the weekend.
1166075,eng,The emergence of stereotypes and TV are closely related.
5968161,eng,That wasn't such a bad idea.
10248463,eng,The staircase balustrade was carved from red marble.
7384403,eng,He wants us to help him do that.

2111883,eng,Everybody paid.
52770,eng,The student who is talking with John is from Canada.
2595642,eng,France has a common border with Italy.
7381693,eng,Mary did it in her own way.
999511,eng,"You say what?! One of my childhood's favourite Saturday morning cartoons has been remade as a Hollywood blockbuster movie? Man, I'm getting old..."
1152168,eng,"Come with me, please."
3975758,eng,Tom isn't as active as Mary.
6716290,eng,Is anyone I know going to be there?
10248492,eng,What's to become of him?
5085938,eng,It's a real difficult issue.
9170987,eng,We don't have any stores in Boston.
6341494,eng,I wouldn't do that even if Tom asked me.
242297,eng,You will be able to swim well next summer.
1342945,eng,We are involved in a legal wrangle over payments.
2768975,eng,"Mitzi thought that Bruno loved her, but actually he just wanted to have sex with her."
5552766,eng,You should go talk to Tom.
6345170,eng,I agree that we shouldn't leave early.
8003749,eng,Mennad and Baya are living life together.
10754296,eng,I like collecting old bottles.

8197320,eng,Let's take a look back at the history of Algeria?
7920439,eng,Tom is an avid hunter and fisherman.
2447432,eng,There's a good chance that Tom doesn't know what Mary has done.
6342249,eng,Tom isn't the only one who knew where I was.
10226634,eng,Ziri's phone is not reachable.
6855775,eng,I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about doing that.
9027060,eng,Skura is a comic book villain.
9687238,eng,She says they want to slander her.

8289316,eng,I hope the next time will be better than last time.
8170606,eng,This is the kind of program Tom likes to watch.

8976337,eng,"We like diversity. ""Do you really think so?"""
2276586,eng,He never saw his mother again.
2602517,eng,Tom's happy.
10079600,eng,I was terribly hungry.
6128430,eng,I imagine you must be very thirsty.
3765188,eng,"What am I supposed to do? ""I don't know. Do something."""
7375378,eng,Mary said that she'd do that as well.
6416720,eng,Mary was angry because Tom was ignoring her.
8856831,eng,Who would forget it!
5916545,eng,You're my kind of girl.
1026600,eng,Tom couldn't explain it to me either.
8221956,eng,I can't download this episode.
8057819,eng,Mennad can do this in six days.
3732816,eng,Tom might be more comfortable discussing this with someone his own age.
2702421,eng,She's still breathing.
3728966,eng,I choose to believe you.
8395873,eng,I promised Tom that I'd be on time.
7872244,eng,Tom is non-binary.
5642614,eng,Let's sing a couple of Belorussian songs!
7169781,eng,I think that Tom could probably talk Mary into doing that.
279884,eng,Please enjoy your stay at this hotel.
6224286,eng,Tom says he wasn't aware of that policy.
4789793,eng,Tom never said that he wanted to leave.
10721486,eng,She's listened to lofi all day.
3911587,eng,Do you have a picture of them?

8276143,eng,She was dressed like a Muslim woman.
9244229,eng,Tom doesn't know who stole his bicycle.
10470945,eng,The doctor told me to lose weight.
4016169,eng,Do you remember what to do?
7185601,eng,When was the first time that you met Tom?
51720,eng,Everybody is subject to law.
6272483,eng,Tom won't be back today.
22952,eng,We returned to Honolulu on April 2.
23008,eng,We discovered relics of an ancient civilization.
8788658,eng,"When I am working, I am a very tidy person."
6257300,eng,I don't need to decide that now.
7142906,eng,I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
2835654,eng,You're supposed to be there now.
4665282,eng,That would violate our policy.
6222066,eng,Tom won't get home until Monday.
9005322,eng,I think that we only need three more chairs.
10240862,eng,Ziri never uses Whatsapp.
6267536,eng,I've decided to volunteer.
8902696,eng,Lot was a prophet of God.
9640758,eng,It is sometimes said that nobility have blue blood.
258819,eng,I am going to buy a new car.
8557020,eng,This giraffe has already give birth.
10092691,eng,Tom didn't go to prom.
33598,eng,It's balmy today.
8274548,eng,He still needs her because she has leverage.
9344875,eng,You made fewer mistakes than me.
280536,eng,"We have the extra-large size, but not in that color."
8818399,eng,Yanni gave Skura major red flags.
4823641,eng,It so happens that I know him.
3181527,eng,We hardly even talk anymore.
2258188,eng,Don't hug the inside of the curve.
7231264,eng,I don't think Tom is married anymore.
2272021,eng,It didn't come up.
3821622,eng,I just saw a panther.
3348127,eng,Predicting the future isn't always prudent.
3174337,eng,She wrote me four letters.
8052239,eng,Mennad has a cabinet where he keep all his supplies.
803345,eng,Many people thought he was too young to be president.
6414870,eng,Mary has already told Tom what she wants to do.
2360817,eng,I heard you playing music last night.
3597714,eng,"I found two videos of Maria Callas singing that aria, one in a staged production and one in concert."
5685179,eng,I think this word is no longer in use.
10231635,eng,Ziri never pays the bills.
2646421,eng,Tom greeted us warmly.
8336336,eng,Things will likely get worse.
1660891,eng,Tom is talking on the phone.
680124,eng,They got married three months ago.
393894,eng,Many old people choke to death while eating mochi.
1177612,eng,Tom told Mary that the cake she baked tasted good.
2271953,eng,I won't betray you.
2891508,eng,It was so embarrassing.
7222487,eng,I sure hope Tom gets here on time.
6123712,eng,Do you think Tom might like to do that?
1950643,eng,We can't act without thinking.
10172402,eng,This isn't what we were hoping for.
9132011,eng,We're biologists.
3924666,eng,Tom hit John and then said that he had started it.
4664033,eng,I've just come back from a long trip.
2367608,eng,"The day before, they had made preparations."
9800403,eng,Yanni said he was in a horrible marriage.

34595,eng,"Come and see, said Philip."
7183973,eng,I admitted I was wrong.
20807,eng,I'm getting sick and tired of Ms Maruta and her noisy friends.
9823921,eng,Who did Tom sell his farm to?
7377169,eng,Mary said that she was really sick.
6159713,eng,Poetry is the expression of truth in metaphorical language.
6645789,eng,These aren't mine.
4015179,eng,"I never had a chance, did I?"
7401426,eng,She explained why she was late.
3155273,eng,Pua is singing.
6245110,eng,I didn't think we'd be able to do that.
2291600,eng,I agree with Tom on this.
4013300,eng,Tom sat on the window sill.
8922241,eng,Tom doesn't have to speak French at work.
10234962,eng,Ziri looked so shocked.
3619089,eng,I don't think I can help you very much.
6220251,eng,Tom might not be tired.
2358855,eng,I have absolutely no problem with that.
7475892,eng,They leave their TV on all day.
7278035,eng,"Her baby was ill, so she did not sleep all the night."
5852478,eng,I sat down again.
3170730,eng,I saw Tom getting into a dark blue van.
10578157,eng,Who was with you when that happened?
2993637,eng,Who was I trying to fool when I cut that slice of pizza in half?
694157,eng,I remember it as if it were yesterday.
2745600,eng,"He was walking, accompanied by his students."
2870422,eng,Tom thinks there's a good chance he'll find Mary.
3444892,eng,Why do I have to go to school?
299263,eng,He gets a little bold after he's had a few drinks.
9594389,eng,"Without a doubt, you're the best player on the team."
7401011,eng,He said he's feeling nervous.
10788175,eng,Tom clearly didn't want to be there.
8381192,eng,Tom is the one that told me to read this book.
917802,eng,I'll take him with me to the hospital.
7159245,eng,"Tom likes Australia, doesn't he?"
6262502,eng,"Tom's school has 3,000 students."
6502608,eng,Make sure Tom and Mary don't leave before I get there.
8788354,eng,"They decided to push ahead with the plan, despite our objections."
2650128,eng,He won't bite.
2876765,eng,She dropped the glass.
5923970,eng,The library is pretty small.
255538,eng,I am quite ignorant of French.

10186024,eng,Yanni showed the picture to the waitress.
8516046,eng,She saw some guy she didn't know talking to him.
9820309,eng,What's your favorite Mexican food?
3723003,eng,I need a new extension cord like this one.
6381643,eng,Get out of there or you're both gonna die.
8208828,eng,Put a little oil into the pan.
6076575,eng,Are we likely to do that?
3148290,eng,Tom's family moved to Boston in 2013.
7127173,eng,How does that relate to this topic?
262339,eng,"I think so, too."
259839,eng,I was impressed by the general knowledge of Japanese students.
7172667,eng,I thought that Tom might need to do that this week.
9809590,eng,I hope that Tom leaves soon.
7772949,eng,I'm sorry that I made you wait for so long today.
2236311,eng,Tom got away.
9086874,eng,Adrar in Berber means mountain.
6660283,eng,I'm going to ask Tom to do that.
6688115,eng,Tell me where to go.
7260918,eng,Tom has an air of mystery about him.
10045180,eng,I hope Tom gets a second chance.
10653104,eng,It'll be hard to find a place to rent in this area.
2537285,eng,Where would you like to be living three years from now?

7436144,eng,Tom and Mary said they'd be willing to do this.
3729359,eng,I'm on my way to the meeting right now.
6661039,eng,"Tom was excited, too."
5951534,eng,This music makes heavy use of counterpoint.
35094,eng,I will have read Hamlet three times if I read it again.
7275864,eng,Sami rode with us there.

2955452,eng,Tom accidentally bumped into Mary and apologized.
10114441,eng,"You know, Fadil, Sami heard Yanni told Tom not to trust Mary, because she had fooled Skura."
8174933,eng,No one knew it was Tom who donated three million dollars to the orphanage.
6512791,eng,Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that again.
3726130,eng,We'll do our best to make it an uneventful trip.
2027781,eng,"Overmuch is bitter, even of pure honey."

6250449,eng,Tom was being treated at a burn unit.
7156109,eng,"Don't go out there, it's raining."
3131721,eng,"You knew it would happen, didn't you?"
8058700,eng,Mennad was with this girl for six years.
8863605,eng,I'll think about this.
7265652,eng,Sami did really crazy abusive things.

8203830,eng,Yennayer is a national holiday in Algeria.
7264479,eng,I did some quick math.
8589683,eng,Tom should have admitted his mistake.
8508469,eng,It boggled my mind.

7408302,eng,They might go fishing by themselves.
433484,eng,I quickly ate lunch.

6355320,eng,Tom will surely do that.
8996909,eng,"Sorry, I got distracted."
2358692,eng,I have a delivery to make.
7168952,eng,I think that Tom is suggesting that we should leave.
6253843,eng,Tom is getting better at doing that.

8904482,eng,The principal livestock is sheep.
7178293,eng,Tom said that Mary knew that she might need to do that.

6647182,eng,Tom told Mary that I was interested in doing that.
9992146,eng,That was what freaked me out as a kid.
6440549,eng,Tom will enjoy it.
10251844,eng,I've yet to have someone tell me they don't like me.
6029321,eng,May I have a glass of milk?
5322632,eng,Light colors reflect more sunlight than dark colors. That's why people are more comfortable in light-colored clothing in the summer.
7198692,eng,It isn't an easy job.
881410,eng,He will have to do that task again.
3905276,eng,Maybe I should've told her.
7202728,eng,Sami was partying with other girls.

8222000,eng,I had no idea that it was so urgent.
8519878,eng,He finally mustered up the courage to talk to her.
6043875,eng,Layla's body was removed.
284583,eng,"When I told him I liked the picture, I really meant that."
7438539,eng,They said that they'd lend me some money.
9936094,eng,Does it often snow here in the winter?
6694766,eng,Everything I thought I knew about Mary was a lie.
8233305,eng,I hope he's not drinking.
3177990,eng,Get a good night's sleep.
7117029,eng,I had a hard time dealing with that.
4700085,eng,Tom is starting to annoy me.
6235462,eng,Tom said that he wasn't living in Boston anymore.
8017760,eng,Mennad is not a crier.
7252602,eng,Sami's birthday party was the worst.
9242152,eng,"OK, what's the plan?"
2361833,eng,I'd better take you home.
7494079,eng,Where did Tom get these?
2764297,eng,Don't lose time!
10132301,eng,"In Algeria, the lack of transparency has led to corruption."
7195075,eng,I asked Tom to come to Australia.
1824742,eng,Do they both understand Japanese?
4501666,eng,Tom refused medical treatment.
7126654,eng,It was a nerve-wracking year for Tom.
903822,eng,I think it's time for me to clean the garage.

9787344,eng,Tom told me I could sleep on his sofa.
7946934,eng,Stop at once.
6223121,eng,Tom likes doing that in the morning.
3995313,eng,"No, I never said that."
4302527,eng,My father is a silent person.
8577103,eng,There's a paper towel holder next to the sink.

7186611,eng,Sami called the state police.
7182423,eng,Tom said that he isn't going to John and Mary's wedding.
7999681,eng,Mennad has never been single.
7219408,eng,"Sami looks like fifteen, sixteen."
2240252,eng,Tom wouldn't comment.
10642240,eng,"Through the Internet, I tried fishing for a job in Singapore."
9146445,eng,The ghost started showing up more often.
6430558,eng,Tom didn't say anything to anybody.
1098774,eng,Ah! How serene is this temple!
7375284,eng,Mary thought she was really charming.
9131467,eng,He doesn't have the slightest bit of courage.
1796650,eng,Nobody hears about my country.
6728593,eng,I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
4500632,eng,"Lighten up, guys."
10160019,eng,It's a good thing Tom left the door open.
10027156,eng,"That was really nice, Yanni."
8594387,eng,Who else waited with Tom?
6357386,eng,Tom said he expected Mary to win.
6621452,eng,Mary didn't like her boyfriends to be too handsome. She didn't want to compete with other women.
3079996,eng,An honourable death is better than a shameful life.
6341854,eng,Did you remember to give Tom some money?
2538532,eng,I'm helping Tom with his science project.
5178383,eng,Let's change this.
8292601,eng,I think that I should buy a new car.
293604,eng,He has great influence over the medical world.
6143128,eng,I've done that quite a few times.
8920210,eng,The dog is crossing the street.
8516304,eng,She looked back at him.
1089358,eng,The only place Tom has ever wanted to live is Boston.
6249276,eng,We should stay in Boston all summer.
5744392,eng,They're of no use to you.
10120475,eng,Could Algiers become the largest city in Africa?
6427622,eng,Mary said that she was broke.
6565810,eng,Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
6270098,eng,Which umbrella is yours?
8015683,eng,Mennad started talking to that new girl.
251998,eng,I had to postpone my appointment.
2033977,eng,"I didn't want to say anything, but I had no choice."
8560885,eng,Algeria is a major economy in the region.
5487795,eng,Have they ever told you that you dress terribly?
1954743,eng,You can't really expect Tom to change his mind.
7329240,eng,Sami knew something was up.
5583644,eng,Tom isn't there yet.
10067828,eng,I always shared my food with you.
310013,eng,She is inferior to him in math.
6125916,eng,Tom didn't seem to care that Mary hated him.
2953917,eng,"We're in the same group, right?"
7070695,eng,Is this a cat or a dog?
3733640,eng,My plan was very effective.
5828974,eng,I'm a pilot.
2020657,eng,She's allergic to cats.
10184696,eng,"Back in my day, you had to pay for things like that."
8836790,eng,She hasn't ever said anything about it.
6502423,eng,Tom and Mary said they were too tired to help us today.
1025807,eng,Tom fell off the roof and died.
7818068,eng,Tokyo is the capital of which country?
6526209,eng,I wasn't at school the day we had our class picture taken.
6225347,eng,Tom didn't think anyone would want to do that.
3920622,eng,I started thinking about him.
6253427,eng,I don't want to work in a factory.
6549421,eng,Mary wore a strapless dress to the party.
8838631,eng,No one knows that better than he does.
7504864,eng,I didn't know that Tom would be able to do that so well.
2014702,eng,I want to make sure Tom is safe.
6241859,eng,I'll never forgive Tom for what he did.
9811988,eng,The men are working very hard.
2359044,eng,I've been asked to give you a message.
285072,eng,Will you tell him I called?
6219702,eng,I predicted that you wouldn't be able to cut the mustard in this job.
7156869,eng,I've decided not to go to Australia this year.
10688485,eng,Why don't you provide the police with your alibi for that night?
3585732,eng,I think we can come up with better plan than this.
8009850,eng,Mennad smokes weed.
10489895,eng,Can you prepare a solution? Do you know the proportions?
319599,eng,Do not leave the lights on when you leave the room.
6342294,eng,I don't know when Tom is going do that.
2414063,eng,Tom and Mary sat together on the couch.
3908823,eng,I'll tell them you dropped by.
4415225,eng,Tom is hot-headed.
6698052,eng,The Romans used bread and circuses to placate the underclasses.
5694336,eng,I think that would be a big mistake.
466914,eng,He threw a rock into the pond.
1156111,eng,Tom ruined my weekend.
9927163,eng,When are you going to have surgery?
6696337,eng,Sami used a pillow to muffle the sound of his gun.
2592960,eng,The first winner of the FIFA World Cup was Uruguay.
9998897,eng,The train was delayed for twenty minutes.
7283133,eng,She entered the menopause.
5607251,eng,What is your favorite language?
7811541,eng,Let's talk about Kabylie.
7258832,eng,Sami lost all hope.
8803191,eng,Yanni lives in barracks.
8910439,eng,She was humming away to herself.
10008746,eng,That's not logical.
7179208,eng,Tom said that it wasn't necessary.
7283015,eng,In Scotland we have wonderful hillwalking.
8259945,eng,She lost her job because she announced that she converted to Islam.
6238274,eng,Tom doesn't believe he can do that by himself.
7130649,eng,Tom didn't know what happened to Mary.
1858679,eng,"We have a problem. ""What sort of problem?"""
2171159,eng,It tastes like chicken.
3424207,eng,Tom has been talking about you all day.
2640583,eng,We're not the only ones here who know Tom.
8529222,eng,"She's really good at golf, isn't she?"
2868293,eng,"You explained it, didn't you?"
7179656,eng,Tom said that his license had been suspended.
267006,eng,The first prohibition of slavery was in the mid-nineteenth century.
10034344,eng,How would Tom know that?
6646645,eng,Tom told me that he wouldn't do that.
2958691,eng,Tom weighed his options for a moment.
3917136,eng,I voted for you last year.
7236260,eng,I suspect that Tom knows that Mary doesn't like him.
6868219,eng,I should have stayed in school.
4500608,eng,Let's listen to some jazz.
7384846,eng,He didn't open his eyes.
8979598,eng,Mary is such a virago.
48689,eng,It is worthwhile remembering the moral.
7172655,eng,I thought that Tom might have been hurt.
805403,eng,There was enough food for forty days.
252212,eng,I like Azuchimomoyama Castle.
8373021,eng,Tom isn't the only one not asleep.
3822510,eng,Are you all talking about me?
2997979,eng,You said this was going to happen.
7400237,eng,"She isn't a team player, is she?"
6530424,eng,Tom used to be a heavy drinker.
25319,eng,Attached is the tentative agenda.
5871667,eng,Sami was spending quality time with his siblings.
10025615,eng,"As graduation approaches for university and college students in the United States, students are preparing for one of the most important milestones of their lives."
6340851,eng,Tom said he didn't have to stay in the hospital.
3419742,eng,Tom is going to need medical attention.
8052373,eng,Mennad is not a family member.
7407378,eng,They often sing in their cars.
1251993,eng,"Excuse me, but could you scoot over a little bit, please?"
5586806,eng,This is all so ridiculous.
3759495,eng,Huh? A mouse sits on my mouse.
6689262,eng,He couldn't fix it.
2952882,eng,I'm the only one who knows what the problem is.
8251288,eng,She stopped learning Berber.
3754642,eng,"In the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was a frozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each piece resembled another, from being in itself perfect as a work of art, and in the centre of this lake sat the Snow Queen, when she was at home."
2970619,eng,I keep all my old pictures in the attic in a wooden box.

10641005,eng,How ugly is that.
7393862,eng,She told me that she wasn't married.
7408264,eng,They seldom go canoeing by themselves.
6228600,eng,I think Tom would like to be present at today's meeting.
7259866,eng,Sami went to his favorite sushi place.
6507401,eng,Do Tom and Mary sometimes fall asleep in class?
433495,eng,Make it smaller.
7400072,eng,She looks like she's having fun.
311762,eng,She was so generous as to give me all the money I needed.
6728811,eng,I'm not even going to try to talk Tom out of doing that.
267177,eng,You've got to help me! Every night I have the same horrible dream.
37114,eng,Tom helped me to move.
5660074,eng,Tom gave his father a tie on Father's Day.
3605224,eng,Often a change in syntax makes it easier to understand a sentence.
7168814,eng,I think that Tom is pretty good at baseball.
7321814,eng,Sami and Layla didn't shake hands.
421992,eng,I can't understand what you said at all.
6246927,eng,I thought Tom might be interested.
9921742,eng,I should better not keep this.
2729265,eng,"You just left, didn't you?"
7976929,eng,This is an accurate translation.

6262726,eng,I remember when you did that.
63689,eng,There used to be a house here at one time.
7493313,eng,You aren't anything like Tom.
10770465,eng,How effective is hypnosis in getting rid of intrusive ideation?

10179085,eng,So you know Vietnamese. Cool!
6436493,eng,Tom woke up at 2:30 in the morning.
6231899,eng,Tom doesn't know why his boss wants him to go to Boston.
49219,eng,It took a long time to put out the fire.
3531831,eng,That's a great plan.
6119991,eng,Tom is a climate scientist.
4983558,eng,They were laughing at me.
7952248,eng,Do you have something to read on the plane?
8872150,eng,How would we go about doing that?
3555818,eng,I'm sorry I can't help you now. I'm busy.
7150400,eng,Why did Tom stay in Australia?
5746070,eng,They're right behind us.
4666623,eng,Things change every day.
10725139,eng,We're among the first.
5734230,eng,Tom joined his high school's debate team.
9637966,eng,Next Monday is our last class.
3020379,eng,Tom's deep voice is so resonant and mellifluous that I could spend hours listening to him read aloud from the phone book.
7778374,eng,The square root of 2 is an irrational number.
6852266,eng,Mary wiped Tom's nose with a handkerchief.
6510631,eng,Tom and Mary said they won't attend the meeting.
6097630,eng,Aren't you getting paid for doing this?
3408670,eng,You said we should do this.
5866971,eng,"The rose is red, the violet's blue; The honey's sweet, and so are you. Thou are my love and I am thine; I drew thee to my Valentine. The lot was cast and then I drew; And Fortune said it shou'd be you."
7387452,eng,He didn't believe his eyes.
2764258,eng,We still use a corded telephone.
6863308,eng,There isn't anything that can be done about that.
2538485,eng,Tom gave Mary a moment to think about it.
7120768,eng,What are Tom and Mary arguing about?
2807374,eng,"When Angela Merkel rang Barack Obama, he already knew what she was going to say."
7279676,eng,Sami used to ride my bus to school.
3238859,eng,You'll be perfectly safe here with us.
3721862,eng,Tom put me in command.
2983585,eng,This explains so much about me.
6409164,eng,Mary told me that she'll do that the way Tom told her to.
10216096,eng,Ziri got that right.
1951572,eng,I can't ever be what you were.
6574898,eng,Sami was screaming and yelling and punching the wall.
6004021,eng,There's nothing to do in this city.
6124455,eng,Tom is the only one who wants to do that.
6243231,eng,I have no idea why Tom had to do that.
5087319,eng,Since when is Richard married?
6251948,eng,Tom grew up in a very wealthy family.
6689555,eng,All your money is in the bank.
1911912,eng,I showed him the way.
3962602,eng,May I feel these?
3023430,eng,Tom looks depressed and frustrated.
67212,eng,One man's meat is another man's poison.
10137477,eng,They were rescuing Tom for two hours.
7393594,eng,"He didn't tell anyone else, did he?"
6507184,eng,Tom and Mary told me they didn't do anything wrong.
8076743,eng,"The sand is made up of organic materials built from carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, completely unlike what you’d find on any beach on Earth."
6422027,eng,I want Mary to say that she was wrong.
7174596,eng,I thought that it was your day off.
8034091,eng,"And when the Lord shall have brought thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to thee and thy fathers, and shall give it thee: Thou shalt set apart all that openeth the womb for the Lord, and all that is first brought forth of thy cattle: whatsoever thou shalt have of the male sex, thou shalt consecrate to the Lord."
6500275,eng,Tom and Mary are smarter than most people think they are.
6676327,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary are both unmarried.
5848616,eng,How did Tom know he wasn't supposed to do that?
7506557,eng,Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book he'd lent her.
6647417,eng,Tom told everybody he was able to speak three languages.
6341901,eng,Tom isn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
6342960,eng,I didn't know Tom had gone to college.
7511911,eng,I didn't know that Tom could legally do that.
6338595,eng,I don't think I'll be able to do what Tom wants me to do.
6274855,eng,Tom said Mary was done.
10519736,eng,He could not shake off his persecution complex.
3723556,eng,I'll be happy to discuss any problem you might have.
5915469,eng,You seemed a little disappointed.
6033336,eng,Hasn't Tom suffered enough?
8554233,eng,We'd better disguise ourselves.
3919763,eng,The dog is barking at them.
4502768,eng,All our members are volunteers.
3312857,eng,We still need a plan.
6456828,eng,"Sami won't find his ball until spring, when the snow melts."
10564063,eng,Would it kill you to be a little nicer?
2721082,eng,How beautiful this carillon is!
3906689,eng,Maybe you could talk to him.
22713,eng,We elected him to be mayor.
9301808,eng,Go do it before your parents get mad at you.
3908746,eng,Please tell him.
6358353,eng,Tom isn't in town.
6956595,eng,Tom gets plenty of sun every day.
7388195,eng,She's already done her homework.
20968,eng,Water shot from the pipe.
6079554,eng,You look so beautiful tonight.
8402998,eng,I've been looking for alternatives.
9701899,eng,The harvest was good this year.
4586353,eng,"Paradoxically, the President of Turkey is the de jure head of state but has no legal role in government."
1524885,eng,Tom had never driven a truck.
9538617,eng,Tom listened for his steps.
6976264,eng,"Where have you been? I asked, more sternly."
8420261,eng,I want you to know I won't be there.
295461,eng,He asked for some money.
7992378,eng,Sami had a racing motorcycle.
51927,eng,Steve did not come home.
7227713,eng,I don't think that you should follow Tom's advice.
8015386,eng,I want you back at the office.
620712,eng,I got him to accept my help.
9668479,eng,They say Tom is the smartest one on the team.
9511496,eng,I hate it when I get an eyelash in my eye.
2588790,eng,Nobody likes Tom and nobody ever will. He's just too hard to get along with.
8480131,eng,He's devastated.
8597061,eng,All our classes have been canceled.
5051338,eng,We need to stay focused.
5502567,eng,Tom is almost three years old.
7265454,eng,Sami knows everything about that company.
6445765,eng,Sami prayed for guidance.
7111359,eng,I don't think that Tom knows there's work to do.
6563575,eng,Only cats have nine lives. You have but one.
6663305,eng,Did Tom really do what he said he did?
6493853,eng,Tom and Mary will tell John everything they know about the situation.
6863267,eng,Tom found the watch that he had lost.
8966939,eng,Tom said he was moving to Australia.
9152709,eng,Tom is working from home.
6435320,eng,Tom is going to be in Boston next year.
8007503,eng,Mennad talked about suicide.
3202089,eng,"Come on, Tom, tell me what you did."
7982088,eng,Sami was hitting on the waitress.
5976286,eng,I did everything I could to make people like me.
7517164,eng,I know that Tom is a resourceful guy.
10768857,eng,Israeli troops entered the compound of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
1690460,eng,She's in the shower.
8013779,eng,"Your dad is your parent, too."
7492600,eng,Tom's computer isn't responding.
5975516,eng,Tom didn't have enough money to pay his rent.
9283109,eng,He was the only one not to understand that.
7748972,eng,I improved a lot faster in Berber.
2007698,eng,Let's hear your plan.
8423421,eng,A stranger stands in front of the room.
9439594,eng,Would you mind if we didn't do that now?
2218488,eng,You're very generous.
7189596,eng,Sami bought some cigarettes at a gas station.
3913898,eng,When did you get to know her?
10039150,eng,Maria came at the very last moment.
5114229,eng,Tom is a school bus driver.
7321813,eng,Sami accidentally stepped on my foot.
8856803,eng,The unit of time is a second.
7999694,eng,Mennad was bawling and crying.
3732307,eng,I think you've been brainwashed.
10242515,eng,The Pope is the bishop of Rome.
6238862,eng,Tom said he hopes to be back by October 20th.
7397606,eng,She never told me she had a horse.
10565278,eng,"Deal the cards on the table, face down."
5360316,eng,I don't feel like studying right now.
2647740,eng,You were in a coma.
6504367,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary really enjoy doing that.
7208122,eng,I didn't even know that Tom was born in Boston.
8819256,eng,No one could predict this.
6515263,eng,How long have Tom and Mary been around?
5789956,eng,What were your expectations?
295167,eng,He accepted his appointment as chairman.
3877483,eng,The play lies now at the bottom of the sea.
10142956,eng,Can I turn on my playlist?
4450420,eng,I perspired under my armpits.
2684032,eng,I was working in this factory.
3619860,eng,I recommend that you don't do that.
9804279,eng,Yanni was really lucky.
6547078,eng,Tom didn't know Mary and I were supposed to do that by ourselves.
9229952,eng,Tom hasn't been treated fairly.
10671968,eng,Tom has just gotten off work.
5756264,eng,"You went surfing this morning, didn't you?"
4008943,eng,Dan instantly recognized Linda.
10109312,eng,My current boss is hard to please.
9808988,eng,I hope Tom makes a full recovery.
8824033,eng,I come here a lot.
7519352,eng,I know that Tom is a safe driver.
8412717,eng,I won't need a gun.
10026941,eng,Yanni has faith in himself.
247049,eng,She had been sick for a week when I visited her.
316666,eng,She has got over her illness.
3161969,eng,Tom has requested help.
10506092,eng,He tends to use abstract language.
1889689,eng,"Tom could have come to my concert, but he didn't."
5851148,eng,We can't give you anything.
10023727,eng,Yanni posted that on social media.
6699066,eng,Tom has a brother who knows how to speak French.
4011964,eng,I'll go to Boston to see Tom next week.
3475216,eng,Mr. Jackson somehow knew that Tom had done my homework for me.
265688,eng,"While you're young, you should read a lot."
281453,eng,Japan's dependence on foreign trade is not necessarily very high as a percentage of GNP.
5217983,eng,Tom's clothes were shabby.
2221143,eng,I'm not shy.
7734643,eng,I wanted to tell Tom what was happening.
8746157,eng,"About my conlang Vling, maybe I just like the word 'bog'. My other favourite English words are 'whirligig', 'tumbleweed', 'serendipity', 'gargoyle', 'jelly', 'storm', 'ambiance', 'steampunk', 'logogram', 'gazebo', and 'thistle'."
1679403,eng,This is the first time I've waited this long.
263873,eng,Everything will work out in due course.
6593170,eng,Sami crushed Layla's head with a pavement stone.
7772527,eng,Lina studied the Ilokano language.
6083703,eng,Yesterday Tom went to the river to catch some fish.
6821968,eng,I'll call Tom before I leave for Boston.
10515894,eng,An apprehensive silence filled the room.
1216457,eng,You are boring me!
6499818,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't have to do that right away.
1019397,eng,"Upon receiving your Certificate of Eligibility, please come to the Japanese Embassy in London."
250358,eng,All I can do is to work silently.
62553,eng,But he suddenly felt dizzy and he sat down again in his old chair.
47974,eng,I don't like that idea much.
10153875,eng,I need to write everything that's happening in a book.
6346352,eng,I would've shown you how to do that.
4361626,eng,Tom never lends money to anyone.
7180003,eng,Tom said that he's glad you did that.
8190158,eng,She can't even breathe in this Kabyle dress.
6944226,eng,About how many hours a day do you watch TV?
2640009,eng,Somebody must've taken your umbrella by mistake.
6352671,eng,Do you know how to use an ax?
3907250,eng,You told me to give it to them.
3689958,eng,He hates sports.
8988792,eng,It had always bothered her: the way you write is not the same as the way you speak.
3854854,eng,Preparations for a military intervention are in their final stages.
7163313,eng,I thought I'd drop in to see you before I went to Australia.
8845017,eng,Tom dropped his wine glass.
6869041,eng,I should have given Tom what he asked for.
3003557,eng,Where is Poland?
6811394,eng,I am afraid of people and myself too.
4008773,eng,There has never been a nation that was not eventually destroyed.
6583385,eng,A sudden noise frightened her.
6430950,eng,I know that both Tom and Mary like classical music.
8682742,eng,"Call me old-fashioned, but I see myself as a puritan."
6157474,eng,"You compose because you want to somehow summarize in some permanent form your most basic feelings about being alive, to set down... some sort of permanent statement about the way it feels to live now, today."
3505878,eng,"Do you want to see the total solar eclipse that will leave Svalbard in the dark on March 20, 2015?"
1123692,eng,There are many rats on the ship.
9230146,eng,The dog was barking and growling.
1433595,eng,I don't know what I'll do.
6484218,eng,I don't need you in my life.
3183826,eng,It's not what you're thinking.
3413359,eng,Do you really care that much?
5828545,eng,Please don't thank me.
3779824,eng,This isn't the end of the story yet.
3504085,eng,Tom wouldn't let me drive his car.
1095943,eng,Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
6678331,eng,"If Tom had been speaking French, I would've been able to understand him."
6345349,eng,I wondered why Tom had to do that.
5831932,eng,I don't think it was fair for Tom to get all the money.
7112484,eng,I don't like discussing my work with Tom.
3920740,eng,Don't talk about him that way.
8103424,eng,The separatists know nothing about Kabylie.
20129,eng,Let us know when you'll arrive.
255750,eng,I'm quite better now.
6203121,eng,"Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away."
8901443,eng,I'll try to fall asleep with the hope of dreaming of you.
6867777,eng,I really liked doing that.
3824636,eng,Maybe I'm just a fool.
7541153,eng,Tom wanted to tell Mary why he'd done that.
6502157,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they don't know what that is.
2789347,eng,You fucked up my life.
8057829,eng,Mennad tried to provide as much information as possible.
1294722,eng,Nobody knows what his destiny has in store for him.
1075920,eng,Even the correct use of participles doesn't guarantee you that you'll be understood.
3203827,eng,Why didn't you just tell me what it was?
6506679,eng,Tom and Mary had to take care of John by themselves.
8224252,eng,Tom has something for Mary.
9286081,eng,Some have found it. Some yawn. Others have nothing to do with it. And others have had it!
6579152,eng,How many pipes does this organ have?
5077144,eng,The library is in the middle of town.
2894569,eng,I did this myself.
7987353,eng,Sami doesn't have money for cigarettes.
8069833,eng,I drive through Tom's neighborhood on my way to work.
7500743,eng,How do you know that you wouldn't have done that same thing Tom did if you were in his shoes?
294624,eng,He got an important position in the company.
6689832,eng,Sami saw Layla's note.
10751516,eng,The TV remote control isn't working.
33204,eng,Bob has been engaged to Mary for over a year.
5109410,eng,I will use general terms.
6108525,eng,Would you like to know why I didn't do that?
264789,eng,"Having put his room in order, he went out."
2675066,eng,Raise your hand if I read your name.
6511028,eng,Tom and Mary did everything we asked them to do.
265666,eng,I lost the book you lent me.
773385,eng,Are you the boss?
7213055,eng,I want that blue jacket.
6504356,eng,Tom and Mary didn't buy everything they needed to buy.
7305713,eng,"From tin, tankards are made; from copper, kettles; from lattin, candlesticks; from silver, dollars; from gold, Ducats and Crown pieces."
6658347,eng,"Tom isn't nervous, but Mary is."
10465434,eng,Grab another chair.
10296658,eng,Ziri wished he had that.
10079222,eng,I cannot recall Tom smiling.
5832703,eng,Are you thinking of telling him about that?
3957542,eng,You live in Rome? Me too!
320398,eng,"Whenever you study, use your dictionary to best effect."
6508733,eng,I'll try to find out where Tom and Mary live.
7500813,eng,"I knew Tom was just a freshman, so I was surprised to see him hanging out with seniors."
6600770,eng,Everything at this upscale restaurant is microwaved.
6272514,eng,I wasn't a bit sleepy.
8607360,eng,The driver was seriously injured and a passenger died in the accident.
2071322,eng,I'll save it for a quieter decade.
264583,eng,You have to appear in person.
5743783,eng,"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong."
10565577,eng,Don't leave yet.
3962574,eng,Did they already know each other?
7963055,eng,Sami has many crazy stories.
6787853,eng,You owe us an explanation.
6518053,eng,Tom and Mary may have to quit their jobs.
9199548,eng,The leftovers went bad.
3329488,eng,Would you please tell me your full name and address?
2445088,eng,There are many people who think that it’s impossible not to mix up languages.
10092200,eng,The separatists want to make Algeria a fragmented country.
2644114,eng,I have to apologize to Tom.
7791083,eng,"Tom helped his friend who had fallen, and consequently, he broke the ice."
8529321,eng,"He's faster than you are, isn't he?"
9944871,eng,Why don't we keep going?
3085161,eng,Tom pulled into the driveway and stopped the car.
10663396,eng,How many different people have you had anal intercourse with during the last month?
8251534,eng,The doctor got angry.
8960818,eng,The bolt isn't working.
3203829,eng,Why didn't you tell us you were hungry?
5829225,eng,I made Tom go.
325426,eng,Speak to me freely.
3905581,eng,I told them not to come today.
4597964,eng,She's not even really pretty.
9685347,eng,This is an unusually short phrase.
10229041,eng,Ziri ordered Rima a sandwich.
1042268,eng,Iran's and North Korea nuclear capabilities worry the rest of the world.
7192315,eng,Tom is a former resident of Boston.
2878542,eng,Don't forget to make an answer key.
7194618,eng,The chances that happens are minimal.
10619225,eng,Her doctor advised her to quit smoking.
8556422,eng,"At that time, Tom was just a toddler."
6656702,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as troubled as Mary seemed to be.
9821465,eng,That's the kind of person Yanni was.
8513002,eng,He started dating an Algerian girl.
2707982,eng,Mary says she's never asked a guy out.
3824953,eng,The gas tank is empty.
6675709,eng,About 90 percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean.
6351324,eng,I wouldn't ask you to do that.
7507406,eng,I know Tom isn't a very good jazz saxophone player.
2247396,eng,I saved you.
3908933,eng,What do I tell him?
280064,eng,It was easy to answer.
6258554,eng,I'll only do that if I have to.
2643895,eng,Tom walked along the river.
3396559,eng,I'm not sure you're going to like this.
3439885,eng,I just wanted to ask Tom something.
9692368,eng,Its surface can be smooth or rough.
10768082,eng,I think we're just wasting time.
2288969,eng,Don't stop until I tell you.
6657684,eng,I didn't know that that wasn't supposed to happen.
3079087,eng,Tom nodded in agreement.
10077928,eng,Algeria should become a tourist destination.
3695382,eng,How is her surname pronounced?
10208306,eng,I will do that.
8833759,eng,It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by Lawrence Cavendish.
7439861,eng,They said they'd like to see more.
1026156,eng,Tom doesn't have any classes today.
10184982,eng,"In a preregistered study, the scientist will design the study before they even begin collecting data, not afterward."
7538703,eng,Tom mopped the kitchen floor while Mary washed and dried the dishes.
8380817,eng,"Tom is sitting on a log, playing guitar."
2093218,eng,"Nah, why bother fixing it."
2991353,eng,Tom gave me that idea.
10365332,eng,I'd received the letter three days before.
9740965,eng,Tom isn't going to say yes.
7163432,eng,I think that I should go to Australia.
18461,eng,Can you distinguish silver from tin?
7126380,eng,Tom kept that secret for years.
9203602,eng,Tom turned his headlights on.
8353878,eng,Do you think that I'm doing the right thing?
6935372,eng,We can change our disadvantage to our advantage.
10145461,eng,"Tom is sweeping the floors, Mary is playing chess, and John is riding his bike outside. What is Alice doing?"
10540341,eng,This design is very ergonomic.
502252,eng,She was on the verge of killing herself.
7137076,eng,I did my best to make sure that didn't happen.
6125492,eng,Tom is getting ready for his trip.
10533187,eng,Ziri needs to make a few sacrifices.
6579356,eng,Tom fell through the ice into the icy water.
6806790,eng,Sami seemed he was angry about it.
3170601,eng,Tom painted his room white.
6426831,eng,Mary did what she needed to do.
3636350,eng,Why's Tom still here?
6022980,eng,I have a feeling this won't end well.
954173,eng,Most people say that the best way to learn a foreign language is to learn from a native speaker.
6270929,eng,Tom still hasn't woken up.
7169170,eng,I think that Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
8384107,eng,I don't have anyone to practice my English with.
6222884,eng,Tom should never have been elected.
285794,eng,He wiped the sweat from his forehead.
7283264,eng,You're a washout in the kitchen.
483268,eng,I'm a computer scientist.
8816199,eng,You're fucking wrong!
7519522,eng,I knew that Tom hadn't done that.
6738139,eng,I told Tom I didn't need to do that.
2543544,eng,I'm not certain Tom is here.
2647676,eng,I'm not really busy.
9425950,eng,He's helped the expansion of LGBT rights.
2953295,eng,Stop acting like you care.
6530106,eng,I saw Tom in Boston last weekend.
49345,eng,The house is heated by solar energy.
7163477,eng,I think we need to go to Australia.
3904357,eng,I'm not so sure it was her who did it.
2006622,eng,She couldn't have expected that he would come home when everything was over.
2280429,eng,They unlocked the door.
61157,eng,"If you give it a try, you will find this game very exciting."
7540459,eng,Tom wouldn't tell the police officer his name.
242116,eng,Tell me something important you learned this weekend.
9982057,eng,We didn't run.
5915648,eng,I can't bring myself to say no.
3419671,eng,Tom had a package under his arm.
6222730,eng,I'm sure that'll happen eventually.
2645430,eng,Tom and I have business.
3808990,eng,The room was completely silent and everyone stared at me.
291923,eng,He broke the door open.
6652358,eng,Tom said he thought that Mary would win.
3919163,eng,I'll buy him a drink.
2954402,eng,You asked us to trust you.
7437191,eng,Tom and Mary said that they did that for you.
9796028,eng,Yanni did a good job today.
3825717,eng,There's water in the classroom.
6436072,eng,I think we shouldn't let Tom do that.
8963038,eng,I began to play the saxophone when I was thirty.
2544260,eng,I'll meet you in the lobby.
7272315,eng,Sami wouldn't stop staring at Layla.
2456626,eng,"The illiterate of the twenty-first century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn."
9754904,eng,Tom wanted to join us.
37263,eng,It looks like Tom won the race.
3920099,eng,I can't ask them to quit.
9096983,eng,Tom was the only one that was arrested.
9375592,eng,Tom didn't run away.
6223857,eng,Somebody will probably do that tomorrow.
273766,eng,A curfew was imposed on the city.
3166141,eng,Tom is the one who shot Mary.
3723807,eng,You are something.
7229987,eng,Sami will tell another story after this one.
8720844,eng,I would prefer to stay home rather than go out.
251798,eng,Mine is not so good as yours.
1868004,eng,Tom opened the door.
7131207,eng,"Tom is an author, poet and teacher."
8947961,eng,Tom won't be driving there.
1024464,eng,Tom may be under thirty.
72035,eng,I don't live in his pocket.
7230380,eng,I don't think that Tom knows where Mary learned how to drive.
7501059,eng,I'm pretty sure that Tom hasn't done everything he was supposed to have done.
2524299,eng,Who's hungry?
435626,eng,What colour was Henri IV's white horse?
3874114,eng,The crane picked up the concrete block and laid it in the middle of the road.
7391728,eng,She was scared for her life.
6350644,eng,I hope Tom leaves early.
6666151,eng,Tom is a terrible fighter.
6974673,eng,Tom felt lackluster.
2047649,eng,We have to be very careful.
7229288,eng,Sami noticed that Farid's wife was there.
53008,eng,Judy laughed at me.
3311992,eng,We'll discuss the problem with Tom.
2407862,eng,I think I'll be going home now.
244821,eng,I sat up last night until two o'clock watching the Olympic Games on TV.
7821205,eng,Tom got a thirty percent pay raise.
2719682,eng,They cut down a cherry tree.
10371239,eng,Justice is an illusion.
8032502,eng,There are about thirty people are waiting in the lobby.
265065,eng,"Actually, I did not witness the traffic accident."
7383685,eng,"She's living by herself, isn't she?"
4132430,eng,"I have a phone in my cockpit. Someone left a phone in my cockpit. What should I do now? ""Okay Robert, box now, box."""
8680701,eng,My brain was telling me to stop.
1095182,eng,Tom could tell by the smile on Mary's face that she had had a good time at the party.
7174556,eng,I thought that it was OK to do that.
6239052,eng,Please give me some money so I can do that.
5795953,eng,Tom was hired as an expert witness.
8474974,eng,His acknowledgement that he stole the ring cleared the maid of suspicion.
2092517,eng,I didn't know anyone was there.
10244316,eng,"When food enters a bovine’s stomach, it undergoes a process called enteric fermentation: microbes and bacteria partially break down the food particles, which then ferment in the part of the stomach called the rumen."
3819400,eng,I share everything with Tom.
259853,eng,I often go downtown on Sunday.
3202056,eng,I told you what you needed to know.
7504757,eng,I know Tom doesn't know why I need to do that by myself.
6692174,eng,"Leave me alone, Tom and Mary. I want to watch TV."
3913854,eng,Do you know her well?
6350590,eng,I'd expected Tom to win.
1114085,eng,Do you want to argue again?
10064183,eng,Let's get this bread.
7406695,eng,They never told me they had dogs.
10268685,eng,I ordered a book from England.
67427,eng,"In Alaska you can see natural phenomena like the aurora, right?"
2852715,eng,I'll take it home with me.
6504667,eng,Tom and Mary are the only ones here who know John.
6724337,eng,Tom was a university student in 2013.
7748549,eng,It is a grave error to use the flag of the separatist group to represent the Kabyle dialect.
2837928,eng,Do you want to play cards and watch the game tomorrow?
7522060,eng,Everybody knows we don't know what we're doing.
8535484,eng,He says she can take care of herself.
1780016,eng,He thinks I'm jealous.
8615147,eng,That guy is a gem.
6659788,eng,Tom eats the same thing for breakfast every day.
6607822,eng,I've enjoyed my stay here. I'll be sorry to leave.
6663840,eng,I had my eyes checked last week.
10195384,eng,The author of the book which would have been the best-selling Romanian novel in three decades was accused of plagiarism.
10138920,eng,Algeria needs to expand its cultural influence in the region.
4014632,eng,Do you sell road maps?
9994279,eng,Why don't we walk a little faster?
7246072,eng,Sami knows somebody who can do this.
256310,eng,I live in Yokohama.
6228254,eng,"You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?"
275566,eng,The heavy rain kept the children in all day.
6527521,eng,Tom shares an apartment with John in Boston.
9361050,eng,They'll stick you to a desk until you retire.
2953632,eng,We have a security breach.
5726262,eng,Some people were downright nasty.
7541529,eng,Tom asked Mary to speak to you about that.
1532909,eng,Tom and Mary survived the bombing.
4497390,eng,Tom tells us more about what's going on than Mary does.
10780594,eng,Some mass of children will eat some mass of tortillas.
9101497,eng,You felt out of breath after running up the stairs.
6271827,eng,I don't win very often.
1365080,eng,I don't like wine.
9810798,eng,I hope that you're aware that nobody is above the law.
2674848,eng,"Since Tom arrived at Guantanamo Bay he has been exposed to different forms of torture: sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, extreme temperatures, prolonged isolation, lack of sunlight and limited health care."
9801090,eng,How is Yanni supposed to do that?
1951616,eng,I can't find it. Are you sure it's here?
3272387,eng,The documents should be sent to Paris well in advance.
622636,eng,"Sometimes, questions rather than answers provide us with more information."
2237580,eng,Tom paused uncomfortably.
6342880,eng,Are you still getting paid for doing this?
6254244,eng,"You're a firefighter, aren't you?"
8531843,eng,He isn't really in love with her.
39732,eng,Let's listen to the people of Deal talk about their jobs and their everyday lives.
1664266,eng,"I went not once, but twice."
3920839,eng,I've learned a lot about him.
6242908,eng,This place is famous for its waterfalls.
6411417,eng,Mary says that she'd be willing to do that for free.
8398380,eng,He had too many reasons to stay in Algeria.
9168975,eng,I myself was born at home.
7996669,eng,Sami has to get the living room cleaned up before his father returns.
10753138,eng,Ziri needs to keep Rima safe.
6898918,eng,"Tom is diabetic, isn't he?"
6525210,eng,Both Tom and Mary know they don't belong here.
6247481,eng,You don't need to be here until 2:30.
7712788,eng,Why are you planning on going home early today?
3604498,eng,His hobby is painting.
4939776,eng,It would be dangerous to do that.
2615370,eng,This is not a fish.
843928,eng,Every nation seeks to perpetuate itself.
6452022,eng,The door opened and she came in.
7516829,eng,Everybody on our street knows Tom.
2163110,eng,This guy is so lazy!
7171665,eng,I thought you said that we weren't going to complain anymore.
6406448,eng,"Mary had planned to stay yesterday, but Tom told her to leave."
6423928,eng,Mary said she's tempted to do that.
21420,eng,The students chose her chairman.
8864768,eng,The coffee is sweet.
9843742,eng,Tom didn't eat dinner.
8078649,eng,I'm glad we got that out of the way.
3494287,eng,"I've never been to Boston, and I don't intend to ever go there."
9210665,eng,"When Tom gets here, tell him to come to my office."
1193488,eng,I don't know how I'm going to make it through today.
2259957,eng,You'll be sorry for this.
5922583,eng,This city is not cosmopolitan at all.
7186693,eng,How will you get to Australia?
6710002,eng,"On the new automated teller machine, I accidentally withdrew 50¢ instead of $50 dollars."
6226393,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't disgusted.
9787659,eng,Tom thinks that you need to sleep more.
6894305,eng,"Now over Ida shone the day-star bright; / Greeks swarmed at every entrance; help at hand / seemed none. I yield, and, hurrying from the fight, / take up my helpless sire, and climb the mountain height."
8643597,eng,Tom studies archeology.
59056,eng,This paper is rough.
260318,eng,"I asked him to open the door, but he would not do so."
10560917,eng,These are all links in the same chain.
802159,eng,They wanted protection.
6524589,eng,I think both Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
6439244,eng,Introduce me to your friend.
4571014,eng,Tom rolled up his pants and dipped his toes in the water.
2387294,eng,I must say I'm quite impressed.
6635268,eng,There are many budget airlines in Europe.
6422645,eng,Mary is only pretending she's asleep.
7363091,eng,Tom found it difficult to concentrate.
6759901,eng,I see that you bought candles.
3721921,eng,Tom never even entered my mind.
7375076,eng,"Mary has already told you, hasn't she?"
9956404,eng,Yanni started freaking out.
8563537,eng,"In this part of Algeria, the mountains are majestic."
6343357,eng,I wasn't married to Tom at that time.
10357588,eng,"Why are you here? ""I was just going to ask you the same thing."" ""Well, Tom told me he had something to give me, so I came here."" ""Me too."" ""Oh, so this is Tom's doing."""
6101315,eng,Sami is waiting for Layla.
7182096,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary was on vacation.
7983132,eng,Yana fooled him.
7506295,eng,I doubt that Tom would've had the courage to do that.
316878,eng,She lost her temper and shouted at me.
6244120,eng,Tom isn't likely to be found guilty.
3128979,eng,The new computerised recording system experienced a number of teething problems before it was fully operational.
7978081,eng,Sami's favorite musician was Elvis.
4008944,eng,Dan is on Linda's side.
3024179,eng,I'm dying to go to Boston.
6224640,eng,Tom has given everybody three apples each.
8557821,eng,"If Tom would've identified himself, the guard wouldn't have shot him."
7219069,eng,Sami felt happier.
681466,eng,I was in the middle of my dinner when the phone rang.
7129889,eng,Tom asked Mary to marry him three times before she said yes.
8559355,eng,Giraffes subsist mainly on acacia leaves.
4529367,eng,That's a very important achievement.
6678162,eng,Tom quickly looked away and blushed.
8477020,eng,He must be OK.
2713199,eng,We're running short of food.
3636007,eng,I'm sure I can find something for you to drink.
7473940,eng,They forgot to set their alarm clocks.
7805890,eng,A spark led the gunpowder to explode.
7903844,eng,Every child can do that.
7966918,eng,"As soon as Tom walked out the door, the police started shooting."
6796664,eng,The cake that Tom baked was delicious.
4048989,eng,Something very similar happened to me!
9026527,eng,We are good football players.
7982102,eng,Sami kept texting Layla's boyfriend.
7472363,eng,Tom and Mary may eat wherever they want.
4663895,eng,It won't be easy persuading Tom to go.
6250505,eng,I didn't recognize Tom's voice.
59924,eng,This theory consists of three parts.
8648745,eng,Exercising outdoors with others has become an avoidance dance.
9701275,eng,What's the state of Algeria's economy?
8645662,eng,Tom is in a book club.
8373046,eng,Where did you get this trumpet?
3909512,eng,I want to show you around town.
8040154,eng,Two passenger ships sank.
10099851,eng,It can be reached only by sea.
8648594,eng,She didn't sing.
9399184,eng,Clean up your mess.
7205527,eng,I don't know if Tom did that or not.
2011677,eng,I want to leave today.
4662721,eng,Tom wished Mary had told him that she wasn't going to the party.
6663435,eng,I don't know what has to be done.
3619608,eng,I can read between the lines.
3730771,eng,Isn't that where I taught you how to water ski?
7439234,eng,They said they're through doing that.
6497864,eng,I didn't know Tom and Mary would go to Boston by themselves.
5753328,eng,I understand my role.
244766,eng,He dropped in at my house last night.
9810203,eng,Just ask her out.
3637904,eng,Apathy is worse than antipathy.
3069520,eng,Academic fraud is more common than you think.
10675877,eng,It started to get a little warm in there.
7472927,eng,They thought that they were in big trouble.
9131646,eng,Where can I put the bike?
6505386,eng,Tom and Mary are obviously doing something right.
6869324,eng,Tom should have told Mary about what happened.
10192857,eng,My yoga mat is blue and Tom's is green.
7237596,eng,Sami didn't know that Farid was an ex-con.
3735657,eng,Tom took a pair of scissors out of the drawer.
8307943,eng,It's really worth it to learn Berber.
8964393,eng,I hope to travel this weekend.
8952893,eng,Tom won't need more than that.
6415506,eng,Mary said she didn't want to help Tom do that.
2642568,eng,Tom was carrying two suitcases.
9983752,eng,Mayuko was wearing a garland of flowers.
3910155,eng,I thought you came to see him.
452282,eng,"Beginners for eternity, stay on the sidelines."
6460552,eng,"The thing is, my cat is shy."
3911312,eng,I'm going to check in on him.
4657523,eng,Such an analogy is inappropriate in this case.
2121141,eng,I have an older brother and an older sister.
6522608,eng,Do Tom and Mary leave early?
8352227,eng,I'm not a union member.
9849532,eng,Do you have a primary care doctor?
453398,eng,I live in Kobe.
6492342,eng,"I don't know what else Tom and Mary told you, but I do know they don't always tell the truth."
872231,eng,His sister does not go to America.
2714833,eng,I have a big house.
7444204,eng,They told me that they ought to do that.
6505779,eng,I didn't want to help Tom and Mary do that again.
5851175,eng,I'm an outcast.
10524337,eng,Scientific work would become almost impossible.
6601864,eng,"Nice Kool-Aid mustache, dude."
3268076,eng,It's as clear as mud.
8908707,eng,I showed Tom the photo.
2958980,eng,Tom's quarters are near the camp.
266199,eng,Magic plays an important part in primitive society.
9141356,eng,Get with the program.
10335771,eng,I've eaten them all.
5886646,eng,What convinced Fadil to become a Muslim?
7270054,eng,Sami struggled with the disease of addiction.
5481121,eng,"Latex is used to make many products such as gloves, swim caps, condoms or balloons."
2250109,eng,That feels good.
6126469,eng,When did Tom tell you to do that?
2823516,eng,I'm a tall doctor.
6257047,eng,Tom didn't want to do that anymore.
7123581,eng,Did we do that the week before last?
6222292,eng,Tom is now old enough to do that.
502362,eng,This time I'll let it slide.
3309030,eng,My fingers are too fat to fit into these gloves.
7437302,eng,Tom and Mary said they felt persecuted.
7199890,eng,Didn't Tom promise he wouldn't do that?
8259616,eng,It doesn't matter if it's in Berber or in Arabic.
7400114,eng,She looked like she was frantic.
5903795,eng,I think it's great that you're able to do that.
3271142,eng,How much do expenses come to this month?
7260447,eng,Sami sliced a sheet with his toe nailes.
2251321,eng,That's very pretty.
8536043,eng,He seems to actually be enjoying himself.
9079748,eng,I am giving you a book.
6630634,eng,I'm happy about this.
1030159,eng,"As soon as Tom got Mary alone, he told her the bad news."
7516122,eng,I knew Tom was a little taller than me.
6177382,eng,Sami came from a broken family.
10497768,eng,It's a mild November morning.
2686356,eng,Nothing hurts worse than stepping on a Lego while barefoot.
7112363,eng,We have lots of time to do that.
8964925,eng,Tom isn't in debt.
9820962,eng,"Today, snow has to be cleared."
3748306,eng,"Especially during times of economic crisis, price becomes a dominant factor in deciding whether to buy any product."
6195560,eng,I don't want to be seen.
7402515,eng,She admitted she was troubled.
678149,eng,I'd like to see her back.
10708332,eng,That hat looks cute on you.
6765617,eng,I think doing that would be a good idea.
4680108,eng,Stop frowning.
3417109,eng,"Tom is jealous, isn't he?"
7681618,eng,He planted tomatoes in his garden.
7220158,eng,Sami's camel was afraid of Farid.
10079627,eng,Sorry for being slow to reply.
7736734,eng,"Tom is going to need help, isn't he?"
8755634,eng,Gratitude frees us from toxic emotions.

They had been in Canada since the 1960s. Their common language was Tagalog, but their provincial languages were Kapampangan and Bikol, respectively. When I was attending Errington Elementary, they had a house whose picket fence was adjacent to the school yard.

8935378,eng,I injured myself while doing that.

6253148,eng,Tom said Mary was likely to still be the one who has to do that.
6648770,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
5279760,eng,I don't think we can say that.
2870397,eng,Mary saw nothing.
5915833,eng,I'm not a good tennis player.
6336363,eng,I wonder whether Tom wants to go to Boston with us.

2046836,eng,"I'm kind of busy right now, Tom."
4497235,eng,Details will be forthcoming.
3227103,eng,I'm not optimistic at this point.

2739932,eng,Tom arrived at the station at 3:00.
6243977,eng,I wanted to go to the dance with Tom.
6657548,eng,Tom got very suspicious.

3823082,eng,"Tom thanked his friends, said goodbye, and left."
6272736,eng,I intended to do that.
3511536,eng,Maybe you can persuade Tom not to leave.
2273583,eng,Tom is very chatty.
6507452,eng,Are Tom and Mary really any good at doing that?

6422281,eng,Mary says she's feeling better today.

2888939,eng,Tom is a very hardworking student.
5836190,eng,I'll just take these.

1492107,eng,I'm so busy these days it's awful.
10157687,eng,Don't even ask me how that makes sense.
6513252,eng,How did you know Tom and Mary were drunk?
5420771,eng,"Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you."
6249590,eng,Did Tom say he'd stay in Boston?

617712,eng,It went without a hitch.
72685,eng,The weather stayed cold for three weeks.
7228021,eng,I don't think that we'll do that by ourselves.

9323488,eng,It's not the demon American propaganda wants to make it out to be.
7180301,eng,Tom said that he wasn't sure that Mary should do that.
7160740,eng,Sami is fixing the lighting.
2287012,eng,There could be consequences.
6432835,eng,You should've let me drive you home last night.
7241649,eng,Sami filmed another video.
7734149,eng,I don't yet know how much it's all going to cost.
3570076,eng,"To be poor is not to have little, but to need much."
9188908,eng,"Well, you've found it."
6352528,eng,Tom was nearly hit by a car.
9992380,eng,Yanni brought up a story he had seen in the news about a man who kidnapped hitchhikers.
8303357,eng,Did you lose your gloves?
7516878,eng,Tom will be here for three more days.
6608584,eng,"“That is the great Grimpen Mire,” said he. “A false step yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite a long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last. """
3915455,eng,I can help her.
240439,eng,The grass in the park is green and beautiful.
6345646,eng,I doubt Tom will agree to do that.
1798511,eng,Do you write love letters?
48087,eng,How do you spell the word?
8108675,eng,My phone number is: 692-267-752.
5826267,eng,Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
6076495,eng,Do you guys ever do that?
317573,eng,I cannot help falling in love with her.
3886973,eng,A beaver may get crushed by a falling tree.
7206122,eng,Sami was tired of it.
6448118,eng,Sami took the bad spirits out of Layla's body.
58267,eng,"There's only one pretty child in the world, and every mother has it."
6229217,eng,"Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was."
391737,eng,This message turned out to be a little hard for me to write.
4665787,eng,I only have myself to blame.
6715706,eng,Sami's body was discovered buried within a foot of the surface.
8414898,eng,Maybe he's wrong.
8972105,eng,The coffee's run out.
4499490,eng,"You're kidding me, right? That can't be true."
4979564,eng,I had plenty of time.
2892008,eng,That's all in the past.
2957609,eng,Tom opened the curtains slightly and looked outside.
7379028,eng,"Mary is making a list, isn't she?"
10231551,eng,Ziri has no milk.
7398326,eng,He told me he didn't feel cold.
10473163,eng,"It's in our nature to be unsure of everything, since no one really knows anything."
267196,eng,"We want an assistant, preferably someone with experience."
1880366,eng,I cannot send you the invitation.
8519060,eng,She poured a cup of tea for him.
6083849,eng,Tom thought Mary was going to tell him what to do.
10230554,eng,Tell your separatist leader to go fuck himself.
7070706,eng,The teacher punished everyone.
318486,eng,Sick people tend to be pessimistic.
7470904,eng,Tom and Mary aren't as weird as they used to be.
2011688,eng,I want you to go back.
5360704,eng,Selling newspapers isn't easy.
7317669,eng,Sami's dog was over Layla's budget.
4664235,eng,What do you think of Tom's cooking?
5502219,eng,That's a fantastic idea.
1517927,eng,The singer broke the windows.
8816719,eng,Yanni's eyes widened.
8290944,eng,He's an expert with a sextant.
56609,eng,This medicine will do you good!
2662726,eng,It could just be a problem with the spark plugs.
6254174,eng,Tom has been doing that every night.
1788279,eng,I must add water to the radiator.
60391,eng,This is how the accident happened.
7401878,eng,She said that she's exhausted.
9248565,eng,Yanni wanted to be seen by a doctor.
10610617,eng,"And you, how are you doing?"
10603696,eng,Ziri can't hit the gas.
8215886,eng,Tom gave that to us.
6267114,eng,You must do that tomorrow.
9363981,eng,We went inside the cave.
8382238,eng,Tom catches colds often.
9162123,eng,What time did you wake Tom up?
9935174,eng,Tom had the opportunity to grow up in a multilingual environment.
2544591,eng,Tom gives us what we want.
7863119,eng,Algerian troops are able to quickly deploy in any part of the national territory in the event of an armed conflict with a neighboring country.
6465642,eng,Where else should I be?
6231707,eng,I think Tom is impatient.
7998742,eng,Tom is going to Mary's house.
8614558,eng,"I don't know what got into him, but he started acting strange."
1918321,eng,She wants to learn to swim.
5255800,eng,Please come to our office any time.
9203712,eng,Yanni and Skura ended their lives together.
2047606,eng,Now listen carefully.
6239633,eng,Tom told me that I'm always too pessimistic.
6523927,eng,I wonder whether or not Tom was able to do that.
6111031,eng,What do you have in your closet?
10114603,eng,Yanni goes to Algeria every week.
5731900,eng,Tom saw something in the trunk.
8738614,eng,Bulgaria is a very beautiful country.
2031960,eng,I'd like to find out where our meeting will be.
2538701,eng,I'm offering you the chance to be happy.
8244207,eng,I still can't put it into words.
328068,eng,Ryoko has a cute little face.
10021887,eng,Look! A bunny!
1268692,eng,Now hurry up and write your goddamn paper!
6449265,eng,Tom banged his head against the table.
8781395,eng,He came to live in Algeria.
7321464,eng,Sami is still interesting.
4382436,eng,Finish reading the novel.
9505457,eng,Not so good.
6410227,eng,I was the one who told Mary that she needed to do that.
10357366,eng,"Recently, I’ve been meeting with my teacher once a week."
5110634,eng,Tom said he noticed a difference.
3936893,eng,Tom tried his best to cover his tracks so he could save face.
3416352,eng,"Paris was born, as we know, in the old island of la Cité which has the shape of a cradle."
5369039,eng,Do you want me to make the decision for you?
10281876,eng,Hunger drove the wolf out of the woods.
10761117,eng,I decided to grow bangs.
3368751,eng,"It is very difficult, almost impossible, to get an apartment in Oslo."
674854,eng,"With this vote, we righted a wrong."
5853082,eng,I was content.
9889139,eng,"Granny, could you tell me one more story?"
6220226,eng,No one could do that.
436695,eng,I have two brothers and two sisters.
7143173,eng,"At that time, I didn't yet know what we should do."
8789712,eng,The road is closed to traffic.
1169990,eng,You're wrong.
7245559,eng,Sami was very to himself.
10541648,eng,They're going to play baseball after school.
9641294,eng,We really don't need any more volunteers.
8183744,eng,I never thought that Tom would come back to Boston again.
2930609,eng,His behaviour was bad.
7219838,eng,Sami is already here.
6241931,eng,I thought you said Tom often does that.
6493348,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John would be able to do that on his own.
6246315,eng,Tom's first book was published in 2013.
8250665,eng,Someone sang.
1092903,eng,Tom smiled at himself in the mirror.
318603,eng,Filth breeds illnesses.
3330005,eng,I only want what's best for Tom.
5851102,eng,I think I did OK on the test.
2833867,eng,I phone often but seldom write letters.
321735,eng,I carried on singing.
1027204,eng,Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
3171031,eng,We should get married.
6411200,eng,I wonder why Mary lied to us about when she did that.
2544548,eng,Tom put on his sunglasses.
6518859,eng,Tom and Mary said they enjoyed the show.
10583206,eng,How could you leave your baby alone in the car?
6335758,eng,Is Tom still planning to stay with us next summer?
8529056,eng,"She's coming for a visit, isn't she?"
3918378,eng,I find her irresistible.
6274256,eng,My hunch was right.
6707969,eng,Sami and Layla's relationship became twisted.
3902335,eng,Tom kept a rabid dog at his laboratory.
264874,eng,The road to freedom: hard to climb.
8412806,eng,I hope that I don't get shot.
7386895,eng,He always had a smile on his face.
1099385,eng,"Even though we tried our best, it was useless."
2955756,eng,Tom and Mary decided to get divorced.
3910727,eng,I think it's them.
8255355,eng,Tom refused to tell Mary how to do that.
2855420,eng,We made cookies.
9169282,eng,"I put my pens in my drawer, too."
7173948,eng,I thought that maybe I should stop.
50333,eng,I had a lick at the jam.
9971538,eng,Tom held the gun in his right hand.
6529668,eng,Tom isn't sure what Mary is doing.
504443,eng,We've run enough for one day.
71117,eng,"You can't imagine it, can you?"
10131862,eng,They enjoy going for walks in the countryside.
5553339,eng,Tom was playing the piano.
8477837,eng,He isn't fussy.
8593567,eng,I've seen Tom fairly often.
10048971,eng,The delivery took two minutes and the postman went to the next house.
7193925,eng,I can't believe that just worked.
3732501,eng,I finally feel rested.
8012977,eng,Tom hurried down the street.
6547203,eng,Tom and I must take care of ourselves.
6162579,eng,I'm not on the list.
996922,eng,Will you pray for me to be happy?
2123656,eng,"Once upon a time, there lived an extremely vain emperor who cared a lot about his clothes but not his people."
8732444,eng,Could anybody explain to me what is happening?
26421,eng,"They did not have permanent homes, so they did not plant crops for food."
7693852,eng,Tom sweats freely.
8370268,eng,It started raining before noon.
2111207,eng,This'll do.
5807133,eng,"Tom is under the table, looking for his glasses."
5651694,eng,I thought I dealt with it well.
7508744,eng,I knew that Tom wasn't able to understand French.
6257985,eng,I suspect that Tom and Mary are planning to get married.
6414595,eng,Mary says she wants to travel around the world.
8056205,eng,I traveled to Kabylie.
238812,eng,The moon was on the lake.
7872503,eng,Tom says he's feeling much better now.
8054613,eng,Mennad saw a black hair sticking out of his fish.
8759418,eng,Tom and I often play pool.
730628,eng,Please don't make so much noise. They are studying at the library for a very difficult test.
6419688,eng,Mary accused Tom of stealing her bicycle.
10669728,eng,Many people watch videos with closed captions for reasons other than hearing loss.
8292600,eng,I think that I can probably do that.
8613306,eng,The moon is still shining.
2070582,eng,Tom is an agreeable person.
5009149,eng,Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary.
5471693,eng,Tom was my only friend at that time.
463270,eng,This chair is too small.
682029,eng,"This signal means ""don't walk."""
8183608,eng,I like everything you do.
9074230,eng,Yanni owns a company in Algiers.
313216,eng,She married him last year.
5794220,eng,Her heart skipped a beat.
2321338,eng,I have a twitch in my right eye.
46432,eng,The girl treated her horse kindly.
9812857,eng,How much do you spend on groceries?
9460284,eng,My grandad is 90 years old.
271915,eng,Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
7135170,eng,Sami has to do something about this problem.
480556,eng,"The strong, gusty wind strived to strip the leaves off the trees."
10235464,eng,Ziri can't prove that.
8417284,eng,Why did you not help me?
10724385,eng,It's epic!
4494081,eng,Tom was a good-hearted guy.
284574,eng,Tell him to come here at once.
388833,eng,He told us a lie.
8237255,eng,"You're from Bejaia, right?"
9159719,eng,I'll figure it out myself.
3733566,eng,I should've been more polite.
5559171,eng,We were just trying to scare you.
6560987,eng,Don't pay any attention to what Tom says.
6008163,eng,"He was born in England, and therefore speaks English."
4502958,eng,Something has to work.
7472058,eng,Tom and Mary left their passports at home.
2111202,eng,Tom answered.
6250222,eng,I didn't want to get my clothes wet.
8045705,eng,Mennad is fooling aroud with Baya.
8183841,eng,I can't say that I'm surprised that Tom did that.
6126686,eng,I forgot to feed the dog.
5738253,eng,I mean that very sincerely.
3157913,eng,You are very handsome and always so strong.
3904193,eng,I'm not angry with them.
6255283,eng,Tom is sure Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
6226613,eng,Tom said that isn't the only reason he wanted to do that.
10505838,eng,You knew all along that I couldn't do that.
323677,eng,Silence is an admission of guilt.
97592,eng,I am a shy boy.
7816299,eng,This sentence has errors.
20133,eng,I've been anxious to meet you.
4630644,eng,Tom didn't approve of his daughter seeing a married man.
3567342,eng,I didn't want to disappoint Tom.
7733098,eng,Tom looked really frantic.
2784510,eng,Are you a police officer?
6507690,eng,Tom and Mary haven't yet told me why they did that.
10068399,eng,We took off our skates.
33519,eng,"I remember it as if it were yesterday, but in reality it was fifteen years ago."
3911838,eng,We don't really need you.
1771157,eng,Their job is to clean the garage.
6414735,eng,Mary said she couldn't keep Tom for doing that.
10313751,eng,"In spring, I look forward to meeting a lot of people!"
7279517,eng,Sami was watching his bird die.
2130693,eng,He is a man who is fond of ceremony.
2427759,eng,"He's the best musician out there, bar none."
1675583,eng,I killed a god.
10298640,eng,Dr. Jackson will be with you shortly.
7537811,eng,"I don't know anybody here, except Tom."
62991,eng,He's sound asleep.
7392617,eng,He says that he's ready to do that.
10460674,eng,I'm not tired at night.
3826783,eng,Tom and Mary seemed to get along.
7191723,eng,Sami is bullying Layla.
2266938,eng,I don't know where that street leads.
8262275,eng,I bought it for my mother.
6531672,eng,I don't like orange juice.
10071643,eng,The earthquake destroyed many houses.
298890,eng,I don't think he'll be able to do it by himself.
7494476,eng,Where did he do that yesterday?
33632,eng,It is necessary that the halls be well cleaned.
7189654,eng,Sami was running away.
6414944,eng,Mary didn't buy everything we asked her to buy.
1649109,eng,I don't think he can handle the truth.
6175310,eng,I hope you did not have any problem.
5007447,eng,Tom doesn't really like Mary.
9824691,eng,Yanni and Skura were both on TV.
10066822,eng,Yanni landed in Japan.
3166111,eng,Tom looked back at Mary one last time.
2570332,eng,One must not mock the tiger.
277928,eng,The audience roared with laughter.
6221199,eng,Tom has never killed anyone.
10081570,eng,I need a receipt.
25367,eng,A bad workman complains of his tools.
21389,eng,The students have an excellent gym at their disposal.
276381,eng,Who will take charge of their class?
53501,eng,"And among the good there are Serbs and Croats and Muslims, just as there are among the bad."
7971420,eng,Sami refused to allow Layla to return to acting.
8182531,eng,Are Algeria's economic reforms destined to fail?
6115548,eng,Tom didn't know Mary last year.
34352,eng,They were to have got married in May.
6461622,eng,Sami wanted to eat cupcakes.
7541403,eng,Tom was found drunk in front of his house.
2014399,eng,You'll want to write this down.
7989532,eng,Why didn't you come when I called you?
2947855,eng,The young couple was accompanied by a chaperone.
57073,eng,The last chapter of this book.
7393275,eng,She promised me she'd do that for us.
8150344,eng,I'm Muslim and I receive this kind of racist treatment all the time.
10098041,eng,Don't you like me anymore?
9957462,eng,It was always easy to approach that teacher for advice.
8536702,eng,"He tried to lift the box by himself, but he wasn't strong enough."
8116454,eng,I don't want to compete with anybody.
6224468,eng,Tom obviously needs someone to help him.
293060,eng,He got quite well.
8773137,eng,He opened the bag.
2889395,eng,Nevertheless I think the experiment was successful.
3748312,eng,"No matter what happens, I'll support you."
6434782,eng,Do you happen to know where Tom was born?
8110422,eng,The designation is given to places that are deemed to have “outstanding universal value to humanity.”
6266580,eng,I don't ever want to leave.
6850340,eng,I don't doubt the reliability of his information because it comes from a trustworthy person.
3185458,eng,I had to stay after class and talk to the teacher.
8594504,eng,We want better living conditions.
2361812,eng,I won't make the same mistake again.
1536223,eng,Do you live in this area?
245339,eng,I was about to leave for work when the telephone rang.
8440777,eng,I like going to the opera.
9460539,eng,He's not his son.
3396697,eng,How did you guys meet?
28526,eng,I had a nightmare.
7736454,eng,I forgot where I left my umbrella.
6425901,eng,"Mary speaks French, doesn't she?"
311203,eng,She was afraid of the dog.
7472024,eng,Tom and Mary replied they'd be glad to go.
252499,eng,I play tennis all the year around.
6097637,eng,Wouldn't it be great if Tom quit doing that?
7511028,eng,I knew that Tom didn't really have to do that.
3094207,eng,Tom talks to me a lot.
5189251,eng,I can't walk as well as I used to.
295466,eng,He invested his money in stocks.
9980873,eng,"In the society with the fastest population aging, elderly welfare is an urgent problem that must be fixed."
7165665,eng,Sami heard another knock.
6267807,eng,Tom said that Mary should quit smoking.
268344,eng,Excellent putt.
8527130,eng,"He's an optimist, isn't he?"
2460860,eng,He's greedy and stupid.
323689,eng,"Shut up, or I'll knock you out."
6274436,eng,I didn't play golf.
8050562,eng,Mennad felt like his tongue was huge.
7725482,eng,Tom called an ambulance.
7173895,eng,I thought that it would be difficult for her to get the tickets.
5738481,eng,Why have they attacked us?
6667019,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as awkward as Mary seemed to be.
3820472,eng,Have you packed your suitcase?
915341,eng,I love green peppers.
10739551,eng,I switched the light on.
9722414,eng,"Although Maria said the same thing, she was aiming for something different."
6616382,eng,There is a fine line here.
2771676,eng,A word once spoken can never be recalled.
2537619,eng,"I'm sorry, there's nothing more I can do for you."
9818684,eng,Our cat has terrible separation anxiety.
6583644,eng,Vowels use the vocal chords and consonants use the mouth.
8378691,eng,Tom is glad that Mary agreed with him.
6251039,eng,No two people do that the same way.
6823796,eng,We've already finished doing that.
8915273,eng,I see a plane.
1283571,eng,"I have a corner in my liver just for you, alcohol."
10228295,eng,He blew out all the candles on the birthday cake in one breath.
2549005,eng,Tom has a new job.
7732456,eng,Tom is running as fast as he can.
2547718,eng,I'm not exactly sure.
10504671,eng,I would prefer to meet Tom in person rather than talk to him via phone.
7170150,eng,I think that Tom will be tempted to do that.
7258771,eng,Layla is a hostess.
7177114,eng,Sami was driving a Vespa.
6649355,eng,Tom said that he thought that he could cheer Mary up.
59971,eng,By whom was this picture painted?
3174769,eng,Tom hardly ever keeps his word.

310675,eng,She played the piano well enough.

5395485,eng,Look at the evidence.

5553345,eng,Tom usually comes on time.

1124204,eng,I'm starting to write a rap song today.
40288,eng,Dan is good at making approaches to strangers.
2012437,eng,I don't want you to leave.
7211670,eng,Tom told me he thought Mary was ashamed.
3446957,eng,"As you can see, the roof needs to be replaced."
9678317,eng,A robot can work more than a human being.
2548690,eng,I'm not the expert.
7117104,eng,We were able to get the message out.
7287502,eng,Sami is really frustrated.
6796488,eng,What did you plan to do?
6220819,eng,Tom and I are both thirty.
8208112,eng,He put his finger up and made the shahada.
26091,eng,I bought a box lunch at the station.
261962,eng,I held the fur coat close to my cheek and dreamt of the day I would be able to afford it.
9925593,eng,We walk a lot.
7169777,eng,I think that Tom could still do that better.
10023030,eng,Tom went there the next day.
3419506,eng,"No, don't say anything! It could go back to Tom."
5886814,eng,Fadil killed Layla for the insurance money.
6253493,eng,I don't think I can be happy here.
9204150,eng,The woman said she would always educate her own children.
8035369,eng,I am going fishing.
3913089,eng,I'd like her to meet her.
8515621,eng,She said she wasn't worried about him.
5915564,eng,Thanks for being so nice to me.
3336520,eng,You are full of energy.
2632102,eng,She tied up the package with string.
6650028,eng,Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary knows how to do that.
7105603,eng,"People said that if we stopped listening to trolls, they would disappear. So we stopped listening to them, and now they rule the world."
7129736,eng,Do you doubt I can do that?
7404542,eng,He told me he was dying.
3039981,eng,The first magic of love is our ignorance that it can ever end.
2931767,eng,Tom may do whatever he wants.
8698596,eng,I’ve subscribed to two newspapers.
8058691,eng,Mennad's jaw was hurting.
1105146,eng,Tom isn't in New York now.
1127880,eng,"He doesn't want to talk to me now, and I don't know why."
1563479,eng,It is very dear.
4663634,eng,There are some things you can't control.
292857,eng,He still sticks to his opinion.
3921099,eng,Tom was cheated.
6651644,eng,Tom said that he was really sorry for what happened.
8477032,eng,He nodded yes.
2239868,eng,Tom was unarmed.
9770517,eng,The shoes are under the bed.
6224531,eng,We shouldn't have let you do that.
245691,eng,The children were playing in the park.
7444900,eng,They told me they were unhurt.
10771788,eng,Ziri felt so suffocated by Rima.
7175973,eng,Tom thinks that Mary would be jealous.
7411586,eng,Tom became interested in ancient Egyptian history.
6915521,eng,This wasn't intended.
8927573,eng,We need to replace the alternator.
9149613,eng,Is that really what you wanted?
8981755,eng,Sirius is the brightest star visible in our night sky. It's in the constellation Canis Major.
6882690,eng,Don't make eye contact!
5746295,eng,Ketchup should be thick.
6339526,eng,Would you have eaten more if there'd been more to eat?
10210135,eng,Ziri is a fishmonger.
894922,eng,His name was forgotten.
2011473,eng,Do you want to vote?
8993280,eng,This is the most sought-after resort in all of the Bahamas.
6124124,eng,Tom is very unlikely to stop doing that.
4014978,eng,When was the last time you saw it?
3620113,eng,I don't like having to make excuses for you.
5923978,eng,He examined the feather.
7471185,eng,Tom and Mary say everybody they know can swim.
8659595,eng,Tom grew up inside a Petri dish.
9090515,eng,Yanni and Skura have been busy all month.
5152649,eng,Tom has been everywhere.
6126093,eng,Why should Tom ask Mary to do that?
8543337,eng,I was in Algeria for a week.
6504508,eng,Tom and Mary are fatter now than when I last saw them.
5747413,eng,It's a really cool car.
7976621,eng,We owed everybody in town.
6038051,eng,Capture him alive.
2978158,eng,"By the way, is there another way to say ""by the way""?"
7168094,eng,I think that Tom and Mary have both passed away.
6457926,eng,The Isle of Man is a tax haven.
6247183,eng,Tom is going swimming tomorrow morning.
9967539,eng,Were you the one who shut the door?
6434184,eng,Tom said that Mary was worried about John.
270710,eng,A glance at Chart 2 will reveal that some of these trade cycles are very short-lived.
9787758,eng,I feel like a blessed man.
5738421,eng,Could you be more concrete?
6842773,eng,I knew what I needed to do.
7767372,eng,"Asian carp, which are not really carp at all, feed on plankton and algae near the surface of rivers and lakes. That is why they're often seen jumping out of the water."
3689257,eng,I lol'd.
6269521,eng,Tom could've been a teacher.
10016981,eng,Our goal is to win.
2954847,eng,You will remain here until you are summoned.
10719591,eng,Let me tell you what I'm going to do.
6517782,eng,Tom and Mary say they followed the rules.
8317835,eng,"It was a nice weather, so we went fishing."
7386876,eng,She'll do that for her children.
8181817,eng,I really don't think that Tom needs to do that.
8355305,eng,I think that I can do better.
2650869,eng,I live in Bucharest.
6349626,eng,I'm sure that Tom will cry.
253955,eng,I was injured while I was skiing.
6356826,eng,I do that once a year.
6796675,eng,Weren't you in Boston last year?
1951523,eng,You can't do this alone and still meet the deadline.
3731875,eng,Might I have a moment?
9681900,eng,"If Tom wins, I'll eat my hat."
8394851,eng,Please give each other a hug.
5848189,eng,Tom told Mary not to help John.
5046261,eng,Tom flushed the drugs down the toilet.
7877503,eng,That's why I didn't do it.
6634561,eng,"Tom, this is serious!"
8787410,eng,Skura and Nuja escaped from prison.
2957552,eng,Tom nodded slightly to Mary.
10126502,eng,Neither delight nor sorrow is permanent.
7235489,eng,I don't think that anyone suspected that you weren't really Tom.
9140798,eng,Wife swapping is widespread there.
8414072,eng,She lived alone in a cottage.
6337800,eng,Have you decided where you're going to do that?
1438809,eng,It's one forty-five.
7393289,eng,He only does that when he's sleepy.
6810316,eng,I told Tom that I'd think about it.
8354371,eng,Tom's face reflected fear.
10115477,eng,"I developed a tumor in my stomach, which required surgery."
5924082,eng,I'm terrified of jellyfish.
9969736,eng,Tom said Mary was OK.
3733051,eng,Tom works for me.
8297081,eng,I wish I'd known what you were looking for.
6557941,eng,Is it true that even among the penguins of Antarctica there are emissaries from the Kremlin?
2852332,eng,How are we going to do it?
2663426,eng,That's a pretty big problem.
6238237,eng,"I didn't think that Tom would do that, too."
6423435,eng,"Mary is really dedicated, isn't she?"
33409,eng,I made a thermos full of coffee so you can take it along with your lunch.
7208541,eng,Sami isn't as confrontational as he used to be.
2237321,eng,Tom looks stunned.
8510913,eng,"That's not all, folks."
7155031,eng,Tom said that his father worked in Australia.
6507205,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary have full-time jobs.
2236241,eng,Tom drives fast.
7436393,eng,Tom and Mary said that they did that the wrong way.
1570547,eng,What's the colour of the door of her house?
8355728,eng,Tom likes his French teacher.
2014216,eng,They were terrified once they were told they were assigned as partners for this mission.
355951,eng,I am learning Japanese to play mahjong in Japan.
7229053,eng,Sami saw Layla's last video.
9665819,eng,Unfortunately we don't know the number of recoveries.
6436685,eng,Tom called an ambulance right away.
6130932,eng,I will leave when he arrives.
5662153,eng,I am encouraged by his progress in class.
8509162,eng,Tom didn't know Mary drank.
7471807,eng,Tom and Mary say that they're not done yet.
10234166,eng,The teacher gave Ziri a D.
7379130,eng,"Mary is a good worker, isn't she?"
8529225,eng,"He's pretty good at that, isn't he?"
3143816,eng,I didn't know that Tom talked about me like that behind my back.
3417237,eng,"Tom is quite dedicated, isn't he?"
6654083,eng,Tom said he doesn't think that Mary wanted to do that yesterday afternoon.
10210507,eng,Ziri was super excited.
6433173,eng,"Tom is still just a kid, so let's forgive him."
8730831,eng,In Hungarian there is no grammatical gender.
6246919,eng,Tom really would've enjoyed this movie.
50719,eng,I know which of the two girls you like better.
8514967,eng,He wondered what his life would've been like if he'd married her.
10213230,eng,Ziri is studying.
7161209,eng,Sami was driving a taxi.
10016977,eng,Tom wanted to set a good example for his son.
9628364,eng,I've finished eating lunch.
2548361,eng,I'd better be going.
9217747,eng,I feel sympathy for Tom.
7392978,eng,He said he's been asked to do that.
7378716,eng,Mary still hasn't washed her car.
6238621,eng,What did you do that made Tom yell at you?
3911212,eng,I owe them 300 dollars.
6270794,eng,I don't want to get caught.
3325758,eng,Whose stuff is this?
3734350,eng,I remember your grandfather well.
3958872,eng,"The Russian prison system, known as the Gulag, was a very brutal place."
7141285,eng,Sami brought back his friends.
7509913,eng,I know that Tom won't able to do that tomorrow.
257321,eng,I studied for a while in the afternoon.
6269812,eng,Tom will be home on Monday.
703235,eng,There was nobody in the room.
6519964,eng,Are Tom and Mary always like that?
3727867,eng,I guess I deserved that.
36810,eng,What fruit do you want?
6228422,eng,I didn't think Tom was awake.
6707833,eng,Is this your first trip to Boston?
6115635,eng,Tom taught Mary how to do that.
3563789,eng,"Now, what am I supposed to do?"
3122855,eng,It's the story of a cat.
10217536,eng,Ziri adores Rima's nephews.
7010022,eng,Tom took the last available spot.
7189384,eng,I assumed that you might be hungry so I brought some sandwiches.
10138573,eng,The crisis impacted large oil-producing nations like Algeria.
8012252,eng,I never speak French with Tom.
7240583,eng,"I know it sounds crazy, but you've got to believe me."
5883030,eng,The kids died without any justice.

5752472,eng,Tom put his foot down.
7237631,eng,Sami really liked clocks.

7229290,eng,Sami's wife was staring at Layla.
3818463,eng,What time do you get off work?

7378648,eng,Mary tried to hide her annoyance.
6225916,eng,I doubt if something like that would make Tom mad.
6274226,eng,We stopped working.
8076856,eng,Tom knew that was happening.
409798,eng,I am a very sad person.
8401411,eng,Tom was kind of crazy.
1342200,eng,"I don't feel like doing anything, and I'm not getting up to turn on the fan."

7212337,eng,Tom told me that he thought that Mary was high.
4741260,eng,Why are you dragging this out?
2144622,eng,I'm already hitched!
63819,eng,"Charge it, please."
6433751,eng,Mary said she thought Tom understood French.
69176,eng,Your record in mathematics is good.
10315106,eng,Close the window before you go to bed.
6237648,eng,About how many hours does it take to do that?
6263939,eng,We waited for you yesterday.
5936508,eng,I would never wear a hat that looked like that.
6583649,eng,The managers are clueless.
253977,eng,I will soon catch up with you.
4321166,eng,Allow one hour to reach the airport.
10735761,eng,Tom's parents said they haven't seen him in months.
7733913,eng,I hurt all over.
2698862,eng,I don't like that idea.

5407436,eng,It's been a nightmare.
10648475,eng,"I now have some emotional distance from Tom, which is really good for me."

5136940,eng,An investigation has been ordered.
6658465,eng,I'll be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
2644175,eng,You understand us so well.
6506585,eng,Tom and Mary placed most of the blame on themselves.
10037737,eng,"If one of us does that, then we'll all have to do it."
3821824,eng,I really have to get back to the office.
8336425,eng,The situation remains tense.
5820030,eng,The scientific research was directed by French physicist Eric Dupont.

60249,eng,I remember having seen this movie before.

7399474,eng,She told me she intended to win.
3156770,eng,Tom put the diamonds into the safe.
5639891,eng,I think that's offensive.
9176995,eng,How many apples did Tom eat?
1961671,eng,I thought you said Tom was your brother.
2808029,eng,"He wasn't only fined, he also had to pay for damages."
6083671,eng,Tom told Mary that John and Alice like playing chess.
2956137,eng,Tom blamed the accident on Mary.
3826682,eng,Tom barely speaks to us anymore.
2653025,eng,I need to study a lot of foreign languages.
4889724,eng,I didn't even know that.
39907,eng,I finally penetrated the meaning of the riddle.

313440,eng,She fainted when she saw blood.
7286938,eng,Sami left the window open with Layla's e-mails.

3310118,eng,We've been friends all our lives.
9962111,eng,What types of light bulbs can be recycled?
990592,eng,I go home.

7264709,eng,Let me just do a quick check.

10131697,eng,That sounds wrong to me.

7137219,eng,"Apparently, Tom doesn't enjoy doing that."
8446578,eng,An old love doesn't rust.
6707758,eng,I'm used to doing that in the dark.
7413871,eng,You can't blame him for being curious.

9561929,eng,"Tom's dead, isn't he?"

47012,eng,I can't express how happy I was at that time.
300426,eng,He looks like an honest man.
6815651,eng,I don't like talking about Tom.
2091116,eng,No one can hear us.
4529519,eng,You should've apologized to Tom.
273053,eng,The teacher told him to study English hard.
8792984,eng,Yanni and Nuja protected Skura.
7134556,eng,Maybe Tom shouldn't have done that.
5747125,eng,We have stuck together.
9464895,eng,Would you like a sample free of charge?
6114051,eng,"Tom will just have to ask Mary to do that for us, won't he?"

9922095,eng,Vesuvius and Etna are the two most well-known volcanoes in Italy.

40710,eng,"No matter who says so, I don't believe it."
10248546,eng,"Hurry up, I need to go to the bathroom."
6267241,eng,Tom said Mary sang very well last night.

9496400,eng,The vehemence of the reviewers on this platform really threw me for a loop.
2064866,eng,We have to send them something.
6427133,eng,Mary said she cried every day.
6922600,eng,Tom hoped Mary was OK.

6346866,eng,I wonder what Tom is looking at.
2323192,eng,I don't think Tom needed to hear that.

8249824,eng,"Every Friday, he had to go to the mosque."
9483808,eng,People like Yanni give our community a bad name.

6414375,eng,I think Mary could leave today if she wanted to.
6710455,eng,I will never leave you.
2808216,eng,That tie suits you.
2952469,eng,I think Tom doesn't really like Mary very much.
68918,eng,Do you run every day?
3431294,eng,Tom jumped up and ran for the door.
6781637,eng,I've already told Tom that he won't be allowed to do that.
3164438,eng,"Tom is secretive, isn't he?"
9451458,eng,I've seen Tom fairly recently.

10540675,eng,It can also be done like that.
7438437,eng,They said that they remember being there.
7236300,eng,I suspect Tom and Mary don't really enjoy doing that as much as they used to.
8566717,eng,She wants to go to the movies.
9763050,eng,He read the book in one day.
10784621,eng,I used to like driving.

10613157,eng,There's no place in his future for me.
7740977,eng,"Like all the other mermaids, she had no feet and instead of legs she had a fish's tail."

10122310,eng,Chinese support is becoming increasingly important in Algeria.
6443440,eng,I opened the box; it was empty.
10138404,eng,The situation will surely improve.

8474985,eng,I don't know when he will leave there.
6809659,eng,Sami gave Layla another chance.
4630315,eng,Tom broke down and told the police everything.
317293,eng,She is an efficient and reliable assistant.
1494596,eng,That's woefully inadequate.
5427855,eng,I would like to share a short story with you.
7443184,eng,They tried to protect their faces.
8529246,eng,"She's old enough to drive, isn't she?"
7379759,eng,Mary is better off than she was.
3428522,eng,You can't really think this is funny.
7130819,eng,Tom is a three-year old Canadian boy.
1849719,eng,How're you doing?
295156,eng,He discharged his duties.
6920729,eng,Was the bus crowded?

6433901,eng,Tom said he thought he should study French.
7515914,eng,I know that I shouldn't have done that.
5077388,eng,Did I touch a raw nerve?
2189930,eng,The best way to see my home town is by ferry.
7562013,eng,I can live with the way things are.
887255,eng,She kicked him hard.
8111518,eng,"Kabylia is a beautiful and stable country, and this seems to bother all its enemies, especially those rabid terrorist and algerian islamists."
7387889,eng,She gave half her money to charity.
8925274,eng,"Obviously, something went wrong."
6532917,eng,Mary burped.
9027810,eng,Tom isn't good at soccer.
3627363,eng,Tom's so unfit he couldn't run out of sight on a dark night.
7408676,eng,They almost killed themselves.
5000893,eng,Here's a new one.
6350308,eng,Is what Tom told me true?
3114344,eng,"Thank you very much for the answer, inspiring new hope."
5821764,eng,How long do you think it's going to take you to come up with a solution?
8387129,eng,I saw several men walking my way.
7150325,eng,We have to get back to Australia on Monday.
9710781,eng,"He usually pretends to be an unmotivated English teacher, but he's actually a CIA agent."
4494695,eng,Tom is always candid.
38896,eng,Please defend me from such bad men.
6245741,eng,Was it you who told Tom to do that?
2954113,eng,Were you waiting just for me?
2239911,eng,I'll accompany you as far as the intersection.
260067,eng,I can't understand what he wants me to do.
7140609,eng,Long lines of people are waiting to get into the stadium.
8805829,eng,The answer wasn't right.
3757067,eng,The keyboard is backlit.
243885,eng,I have heard nothing of him lately.
8017818,eng,Mennad is a social butterfly and has tons of friends.
6115201,eng,Charles is still alive!
1884528,eng,Tom comes to Boston every two months.
279092,eng,Country people are often afraid of strangers.
737819,eng,"Behind every animal on the Chinese zodiac lies an array of proverbs, sayings and stories."
6387588,eng,Sami offered Layla some money.
8266725,eng,He was offered a job at a mine in Algeria.
3024028,eng,Something seems to have caught Tom's attention.
6712682,eng,"Today, dangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not inevitable."
2955055,eng,You're the only one who can help.
7240059,eng,I know it's highly unlikely I'll be able to convince you that you're wrong.
7117886,eng,Tom seemed to be influential.
3913788,eng,We can't just leave them.
3120836,eng,She already has a new boyfriend.
2721345,eng,We told the dog to stay.
10225426,eng,Rima looked so sexy.
10201603,eng,"The teacher got Tom to recite the times tables, which he did effortlessly and flawlessly."
4632122,eng,She completely ignored me.
6343107,eng,Who told you that Tom didn't do that?
70266,eng,How many books do you read a month?
7933699,eng,He stumbled and dropped his bowl of soup on the floor.
6912204,eng,I'll pick you up at your hotel at 2:30.
3853879,eng,I'd like to schedule an appointment.
270550,eng,"If you would succeed in life, you must work hard."
6658418,eng,I'm getting a lot better at reading French.
6527108,eng,Tom isn't going to let anything happen to Mary.
291237,eng,He made a profit of ten thousand dollars on the sale.
8576257,eng,I didn't fall asleep like everybody else did.
6500631,eng,Tom and Mary weren't able to make themselves understood.
6125628,eng,I thought I heard Tom was going to be here.
9714478,eng,Friends and family gathered to commemorate Yanni's life.
8955755,eng,The dress that Mary is wearing looks expensive.
6440835,eng,Sami was legally dead.
279401,eng,It is OK to redistribute the unregistered trial version.
6502446,eng,Could you tell me what Tom and Mary are planning to do?
7512962,eng,I want you to know that I'll never do that.
3527120,eng,The newborn calf couldn't catch up with the herd running from the jaguar.
9354539,eng,"If Yanni goes to Algeria, Skura would never see him again."
637314,eng,I like to decorate my room with flowers.
8910300,eng,The heating must be repaired.
6659607,eng,"Tom told me not to talk to Mary, but I'll let her anyway."
8625032,eng,Tom asked his friend if he wanted to come over.
6476381,eng,Sami is faithful.
7384577,eng,She almost never uses her phone.
2203198,eng,We're popular.
4017252,eng,Have you already called an ambulance?
6594384,eng,Sami wanted to catapult Layla to celebrity status.
10771918,eng,Ziri became Rima's archenemy.
7386254,eng,She told me about her dog.

255957,eng,I broke the vase on purpose.
6231110,eng,I don't have enough money to buy the computer I want.
6020451,eng,"I need a screwdriver, stat!"
7152913,eng,Tom stayed in Australia last year.
6849341,eng,I don't agree with what you just said.
3846289,eng,We do not respect the environment as much as we should.
7474535,eng,They need somebody they could trust.
7130786,eng,Tom is probably going to be truthful.
6045817,eng,Burn down the ghetto.
1159917,eng,"Over and over again, he read the letter she had mailed him, but he still did not understand it."
43690,eng,The problem closely relates to our everyday life.
6244569,eng,I'd like about three kilograms of potatoes.
7866417,eng,Colonial France deported many Algerians to French Guiana and New Caledonia.
10222371,eng,Ziri has a drivers' license.
6342541,eng,It took me only thirty minutes to do that.
8351815,eng,We were both impatient to leave the party.
6658075,eng,I'm likely to get into trouble if I do that.
7510339,eng,I didn't know Tom had already done that for us.
10783067,eng,I want to go someplace where no one else has ever been.
6339476,eng,Tom and I don't ever stay angry at each other very long.
5178435,eng,Let's not wait for Tom.
7294442,eng,Sami went there to meet Layla after one of her classes.
6432720,eng,Tom called to say he wouldn't be home for lunch.
328320,eng,"You've already drunk mummy's milk. Don't cry, please go sleepy-sleep."
5859324,eng,I turned up the TV.
4538046,eng,It's usually easy for Norwegians to understand what Swedes are saying.
7542397,eng,Tom wasn't able to get what he wanted.
7518465,eng,I know Tom is a pretty good singer.
4495087,eng,We were proactive.
8530671,eng,Mary took a walk.
10545402,eng,The nice thing about Hungarian is there's no gender.
28792,eng,We are subject to the laws of nature.
6526664,eng,Tom said Mary knew he wanted to do that by himself.
10528475,eng,I mailed a parcel to Tom.
1517157,eng,You can see that the architect paid scrupulous attention to detail.
8655521,eng,"A new job, a new environment would be good for you."
7245270,eng,Sami shaved Layla's head.
8396496,eng,Mogadishu is Somalia's capital.
6094808,eng,Layla moved in.
2048773,eng,"You have a good plan, Comrade Zhukov."
1026680,eng,Tom climbed down from the tree.
7511794,eng,I knew that Tom was at home waiting for Mary.
8260161,eng,Everyone is an Algerian here.
6661077,eng,Tom isn't playing the piano.
3911841,eng,We don't really need her.
7509987,eng,I know that Tom is in his bedroom sound asleep.
6912408,eng,Tom died without a will.
7871255,eng,"And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed: Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not."
1841567,eng,They can't push us around.
8001441,eng,Mennad's ears were bleeding.
7785094,eng,I bought two packets of pistachios.
3377144,eng,That's the way we like it.
6702237,eng,Do you think plants feel pain?
6272662,eng,Tom said Mary wasn't supportive.
6360712,eng,I see a big star in the sky.
72272,eng,Take the express train from platform 9.
3287393,eng,Maybe Tom said something he shouldn't have.
7190440,eng,I assume that you know the way to Tom's house.
3367439,eng,My ex girlfriend's ex just called me out of the blue.
2091190,eng,No one knows me like you do.
8604424,eng,They all look like Mafiosi.
29808,eng,The rugby ball is shaped something like an egg.
3669236,eng,This TV is made in Korea.
6717921,eng,Sami wanted to avoid punishment.
10483910,eng,Tom wanted to hang out with his friends in the park.
1092387,eng,Tom was lucky enough to find a good job.
9426005,eng,He nervously opened the front door.
1690629,eng,He's very talented.
10372248,eng,"You don't actually believe that story, do you?"
6417419,eng,The umbrella Mary was carrying wasn't hers.
9323509,eng,"Tom didn't break everything, but he broke almost everything."
6347672,eng,Tom's speech was very interesting.
302282,eng,He went to see her in hospital every other day.
10132406,eng,Algeria could export excess power to neighboring countries?
1079162,eng,I saw a child called Tonio Evans.

6812426,eng,I have three hours to finish writing this report.
4321238,eng,I often played truant.
7856635,eng,"Tobacco smoke contains hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas."
257048,eng,I expect you all to do your best.
258839,eng,I lean toward accepting the proposal.
3204569,eng,I told Tom that today's meeting was canceled.
6106202,eng,"Why is it after all this time, I still cannot learn English well?"
1424478,eng,Will it be love?
7063792,eng,Do you know Tom's password?
2026360,eng,Don't you want to talk to Tom about it?
5882997,eng,The nurses kept a close eye on Fadil.
1661594,eng,Five or ten minutes would not have made any difference.
280462,eng,The street is like a tunnel of a paper flowers.
1542552,eng,It started as a hobby.
5951801,eng,Thank you for agreeing to meet with us.
1096485,eng,I can't hear what you're saying.
1027688,eng,We watched Tom and Mary playing handball.
9012989,eng,"Some programming languages are developed by major technology companies to improve their productivity, such as Go being developed by Google, and Swift by Apple."

1497892,eng,I don't like filter coffee.
1037061,eng,"In Esperanto, nouns end in ""o"". The plural is formed by adding a ""j""."
10529066,eng,I'm sure that we can work it out.
293725,eng,He likes to travel by himself.
1023987,eng,Tom was executed.
4628623,eng,She told me what was happening there.
10032729,eng,That isn't even an issue.
6408352,eng,"Mary thought Tom was moving to Boston, but she was mistaken."
9120441,eng,"Yanni was just crouched down in the corner, facing the wall."
6502971,eng,Tom and Mary didn't tell me they couldn't speak French.
3123639,eng,I've always considered you a friend.
6976173,eng,Her name then was Mrs. Hebron.
1570098,eng,This product has annual sales of about $80 million.
6310924,eng,The girl blew a kiss at the boy.
9370283,eng,"I'd like to believe that, but I don't."
309283,eng,Her behavior is worthy of reverence.
6805693,eng,I should never have come to Boston.
46230,eng,I cannot help laughing at the joke.
293902,eng,He put emphasis on the importance of the exercise.
5483651,eng,Tom was staring at you.
8403656,eng,"You're a beauty, Skura."
293971,eng,"He speaks Spanish, not to mention English and German."
9004768,eng,What animals hibernate?
2757594,eng,You want to vote?
260163,eng,I thought he might come.
10657275,eng,He's in his underwear.
528248,eng,I go there every year.
8591816,eng,I'm sure that I've seen this shirt in the warehouse.
10136701,eng,Our content isn't accessible in Algeria.
7289259,eng,Sami didn't want to be a part of that.
3911175,eng,What do you owe her?
6825909,eng,Jean often eats lunch quickly.
4502448,eng,It's hardly surprising.
8456365,eng,Tom was scared of my dog.
1028817,eng,Tom had lunch with Mary.
10659819,eng,I wish I'd been able to buy another one of these.
2373525,eng,"Make the most of life; because once you are dead it will be for a long time, a really long time."

680190,eng,Anarchy can happen during wartime.
4335495,eng,Tom's memory's getting worse as he gets older.
7200091,eng,Sami was sassy with the customer.
7544402,eng,Tom drove home from the gym.
5135497,eng,We need to address the overcrowding among the refugees immediately otherwise more will die as summer approaches.
300746,eng,He felt utterly humiliated.
6336654,eng,I wonder whether Tom realizes how long it'll take to do that.
10222691,eng,This is my Ziri.
10555411,eng,We have enough to eat.
398123,eng,I is an other.
6244662,eng,I want to avoid doing that if possible.
260900,eng,I remember him well.
9054403,eng,The Prime Minister isn't willing to tell the truth.
8536974,eng,"He was in a hurry to catch the bus, so he didn't stop to talk with her."
6582725,eng,He's a football player.
6570110,eng,Sami threw feces on Layla's yard.
31821,eng,Meg talks too much.
802192,eng,They were conservative men.
61361,eng,What are the main sights around here?
6445433,eng,Sami encouraged tolerance and dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims.
4015189,eng,This might not be a very good idea.
1582788,eng,She had scarcely finished speaking when he cut in.
2272725,eng,Tom has gone below.
2663128,eng,Tom has problems dealing with Mary.
4719443,eng,We'll have to tighten our belts if the economy doesn't pick up soon.
1951926,eng,Who should I vote for?
9210302,eng,I lost my cellphone charger.
3907576,eng,That belonged to him.
742976,eng,"They express disagreement by shaking their heads, which may indicate agreement in other countries."
5939043,eng,You look pretty sick.
10079711,eng,That sounds sensible to me.
7186484,eng,I'm here in Australia with Tom.
7449785,eng,Why does she have to go to France?
10077825,eng,Algeria is the largest African nation.
2587848,eng,The city is two miles away.
5118191,eng,There's nothing surprising about that.
9411169,eng,You're such a cheater.
9716115,eng,Sunday is not a workday.
6512766,eng,It looks like Tom and Mary are exhausted.
8622818,eng,"How about some pizza? ""Sure! I could use a break."""
9281219,eng,Yanni felt safer with his grandmother.
855749,eng,I'm not in the mood to help you.
56689,eng,This problem can not be discussed here for lack of time.
10071224,eng,It's finally October.
7799798,eng,"All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter; Pope and Czar, Mettemich and Guizot, French radicals and German police spies."
10249782,eng,He overestimates himself.
10315029,eng,Nowadays it's possible to watch soccer games online.
8249519,eng,"Before he converted to Islam, he didn't know how to read and write."
10650067,eng,This thought was by no means comforting.
9434148,eng,Their language is only Kabyle.
6528554,eng,It's going to have to be done tomorrow.
10792932,eng,"The origin of Yankee Doodle, perhaps the most famous American national air, is unknown. It is supposed to have been an English tune. At any rate, it was introduced into America by the British troops in 1775."
9740871,eng,Are you a glass half full or a glass half empty kind of person?
887078,eng,She didn't try to evade the truth.
3415283,eng,What could it mean?
7168593,eng,I think that Tom is from Australia.
6494777,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't think John would like their friends.
271595,eng,What is the exact time?
1570085,eng,He has gone blind in both eyes.
7123161,eng,How smart could such a person be?
3619727,eng,We might have to hire some new waiters.
3203847,eng,Tom promised Mary he wouldn't tell John.
7134435,eng,I don't think that Tom should be doing that.
19524,eng,The salary is fixed according to age and experience.
7697545,eng,Siberian Huskies have a thick fur coat.
10159816,eng,Tom advanced slowly.
10159348,eng,Does your mum know where you are?
8814933,eng,To hope is to enjoy.
5834395,eng,"Cod fritters are delicious, but absorb lots of fat."
4481883,eng,Esperanto is much simpler than Interlingua.
5772159,eng,Do you know anything else about her?
9805179,eng,How long do babies carry their mother's immunity?
7159916,eng,I was in Australia last summer.
6518643,eng,Tom and Mary are going there alone.
6239099,eng,Tom injured himself when he tried to do that.
6457075,eng,I went to wash my hands.
10091725,eng,Tom doesn't have a girlfriend yet.
294197,eng,He went to Italy for the purpose of studying music.
306169,eng,They left early to catch the first train.
6342124,eng,I think Tom wouldn't actually eat that.
7501353,eng,I know sooner or later I'm going to have to do that if no one else does.
34757,eng,I'd like to marry a girl who likes to play video games.
2019191,eng,They just want an excuse to fire you.
6709141,eng,"Sami was glued to the window, waiting for his mother to appear."
2609616,eng,I'd like to go on a date wearing my school uniform while I'm still in high school.
5974649,eng,You're not playing the accompaniment softly enough.
3202352,eng,Who told you that you could sit here?
2640207,eng,Tom didn't know what time he needed to show up.
3200321,eng,Tom is going to tell Mary.
7725769,eng,"Sorry, but I can't have dinner with you tonight."
7229656,eng,I don't think Tom is as smart as Mary is.
8748123,eng,The helmets are equipped with portable thermal scanners.
9192493,eng,My mom packed our suitcases.
10087916,eng,Would you like to tag along?
29444,eng,Stand back from the rope.
2198601,eng,I think she's hiding something from me.
10139251,eng,This is Morocco's untamable and ungovernable frontier.
7441503,eng,They'll be very sorry they did that.
1816601,eng,He teaches Arabic in the United States.
5008901,eng,That's likely true.
6409230,eng,Mary says she hopes Tom will be able to do that tomorrow.
10713623,eng,This is my partner.
9402049,eng,Yanni never heard from that man again.
9518622,eng,"The boil on Marcelus' thigh was swollen, painful and warm to the touch."
9010438,eng,"The five states of matter are solid, liquid, gas, plasma, and cat."
3523641,eng,We can't do this without Tom.
8301509,eng,How did he learn of his son's death?
4606586,eng,"If you give Tom any lead way, he'll probably just walk all over you."
7735776,eng,Tom was dating Mary at the time.
7543106,eng,Tom is a thirty-year old policeman.
3426150,eng,That's the same thing I would've done.
3373029,eng,You're looking a little pale.
3132892,eng,What happened affected my whole family.
5586324,eng,This is too spicy for me.
699994,eng,If you really want to get to know a place you have to go off the beaten track.
1460981,eng,We pitched the tent next to the river.
2439782,eng,They spoke too quickly for me to understand.
6417946,eng,Mary is good at almost everything she does.
6493796,eng,Tom and Mary are pretty proud of what they've been able to accomplish.
7113989,eng,I know why Tom got lonely.
1816996,eng,You tell us interesting stories.
6422067,eng,Did Mary say she thought that was fun?
5974038,eng,Tom lives in Rome.
10727859,eng,"Why can't the city grow fruit trees everywhere? ""Because every world leader wears adult diapers and sits in their filth all day long."""
5915700,eng,People say I'm a good surgeon.
2273155,eng,Tom is getting emotional.
6408898,eng,Mary said that she wasn't the only one who had to do that.
7473982,eng,They didn't dare to open their mouths.
9550265,eng,I take his place.
2492864,eng,Have you counted the towels?
6157144,eng,"I don't know, I never asked him about that."
10206959,eng,Ziri got a call from Rima.
2801123,eng,It is a wonderful ring!
10096640,eng,Yanni copied Skura's movements.
547416,eng,Either one of you has to go there.
5937305,eng,You seem to be used to doing this.
7112661,eng,"The bullets ricocheted, injuring Tom."
8343280,eng,This is my song!
8365961,eng,He speaks English a bit.
3573156,eng,Sport doesn't interest me.
6432212,eng,It's probably going to be tough for you to do that.
8324964,eng,Alan Jackson is an excellent singer.
16985,eng,How many schools are there in your city?
3905841,eng,Don't mention this to her.
3162008,eng,Tom called out for help.
8574710,eng,"Where his daughter's musical talent comes from, her father doesn't know. He and his wife don't have a musical bone in their bodies, he says."
1356755,eng,Are you a typist?
2144582,eng,He went on with his list.
10081392,eng,You're so much happier now.
5285997,eng,Tom loves to write.
9793520,eng,Yanni needs to find somebody else.
6575214,eng,Sami took advantage of the situation.
9771397,eng,This fig tastes amazing.
4015561,eng,Do you think Tom really did this without any help?
263998,eng,"Take your time, or you may make some mistake."
2359604,eng,I've got a lot to offer.
9705028,eng,"Unfortunately, to the extent that we choose societal coexistence, the absolute freedom to act ceases to apply."
8564833,eng,But this is public property and the press is entitled to access.
7404322,eng,He promised me he'd help.
276585,eng,No one was present at the meeting.
69783,eng,You should not go alone.
6407848,eng,Mary doesn't think she'll be able to finish the job by herself.
10611096,eng,"I've seen you before, but I can't remember where."
1028931,eng,Tom first met Mary when they were in high school.
9030729,eng,We used to date actors.
8206026,eng,Good thing he didn't come today.
1356997,eng,Not even me!
7610263,eng,He is her only child.
10712225,eng,I won't walk kilometers.
9804161,eng,Yanni and Skura love each other.
6093932,eng,Don't you trust Tom yet?
664980,eng,I cannot distinguish a frog from a toad.
6003948,eng,I can't bike very fast.
6432535,eng,It's going to take forever to clean this mess up.
7178670,eng,Tom said that Mary isn't jealous.
6430032,eng,"You know that Tom is still planning on joining the team, don't you?"
8763979,eng,Free Israel!
5342498,eng,Tom's mail-order bride demanded that he treat her like a human being.
1928020,eng,What's the next step to be done?
5706263,eng,"What does ""cultural relativism"" mean to you?"
5756823,eng,This is our moment.
873916,eng,Valencia is a much fitter candidate for student body president than her competitors.
6353908,eng,Tom didn't sound convinced.
2569068,eng,He's a science teacher.
3906804,eng,We wish to speak to her.
1784,eng,I don't understand German.
3724223,eng,The punishment for Tom shall be death.
7770177,eng,Different family backgrounds made their communication harder because the values they hold and the ways they think differ significantly.
6688072,eng,Tell me how to get to the bank.
8826794,eng,The club accepted him as a member.
3495004,eng,Tom has been bitten by a snake.
6912173,eng,Tom must pay what he owes.
5105734,eng,Tom hated his mother.
7805708,eng,His level of Spanish should still be improved.
7391453,eng,He tried to hide his anger.
9142908,eng,"Ozone is good up high, bad nearby."
62238,eng,I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
6237197,eng,Tom is now richer than he ever thought he'd be.
282581,eng,The girl in a white uniform took my temperature.
9414294,eng,Tom felt his strength leave him.
8040142,eng,Most of the children were unable to read or write.
4665151,eng,We wish you continued success.
1619581,eng,He's a world-class scientist.
6043872,eng,Layla shot Sami between the eyes.
6229277,eng,Tom could've been finished doing that by now if he hadn't wasted so much time.
10624940,eng,He is wanted.
2239881,eng,Tom wasn't celebrating.
7443774,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they'd wait for us.
7173707,eng,I thought that you said that you'd rather do that yourself.
6251361,eng,I don't think Tom is reliable.
5397065,eng,I'm not miserable. I'm just not happy.
8419240,eng,"I know I've met that guy over there, but I don't remember his name."
7376572,eng,"Mary is quite proficient, isn't she?"
40903,eng,He who is afraid of asking is ashamed of learning.
8133006,eng,She's a good eye doctor.
3413173,eng,Tom doesn't have it now.
6342658,eng,I thought you used to be a French teacher.
2675076,eng,"Even though I'm sitting here in the sun, I'm still cold."
6509780,eng,I live on the same floor as Tom and Mary do.
9978357,eng,Yanni just bougth the cheapest windshield.
4666542,eng,Tom was the coordinator.
7494255,eng,Where did he learn to write?
2542990,eng,I'm going to leave a message.
2361596,eng,I have a personal matter to take care of.
3447140,eng,Tom is proud of his sons.
10587870,eng,"Maybe one day, Ziri will help Rima."
2993730,eng,Helsinki is the capital city of Finland.
9149128,eng,The soldiers did not agree to the orders of the commander.
2990596,eng,It's about time you woke up.
7858792,eng,Algeria needs to develop its tourism sector.
5292773,eng,Tom said he heard Mary's voice.
6448326,eng,Sami never saw Layla so mad.
7444106,eng,They told me that they weren't ready to go.
10561049,eng,Tom often pours maple syrup on pancakes or waffles.
6349845,eng,Tom is teaching at a university.
6664448,eng,Tom got mad at us for doing that.
9975636,eng,Yanni never uses cheap materials in order to fix his windshield.
6512985,eng,Tom and Mary locked themselves in their rooms.
311242,eng,She hovers over that child like a hen with one chick.
1027902,eng,Tom told Mary that she couldn't just make up the rules as she went along.
1893821,eng,We have to find Tom before the police do.
8003490,eng,Mennad said he cared.
6490485,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John would need at least $300 to buy everything he needed.
2542900,eng,I'm sure Tom had his reasons.
7389284,eng,She's the lead singer of her band.
6355395,eng,Tom wasn't always right.
3030984,eng,I'm not drunk. I'm as sober as a judge.
8012434,eng,Mennad doesn't do this.
5053108,eng,"Tomorrow is not a promise, but a chance."
8624388,eng,Mary's fear came true.
8324551,eng,What makes you think that Tom is still a high school student?
7811214,eng,Berber is prevalent in many regions of Algeria.
5649118,eng,Men should always treat women with respect.
681067,eng,Many people in my grandfather's generation grew up on farms.
6576831,eng,Ask your peers.
6071449,eng,Would you like to watch another movie?
8962344,eng,"Athletic dollars from basketball, football and baseball can contribute more than half to a school's operating budget."
7759740,eng,The castle is in need of repairs.
4573061,eng,Free Palestine!
9237395,eng,"In 2020, virtual reality is becoming an escape for many."
5153922,eng,Tom said he thought we should try to get there early.
6866404,eng,Any suggestions and ideas are welcome.
291003,eng,He has given up trying to put the papers in order.
6539123,eng,Tom backed out at the last minute.
7405488,eng,She said she felt hated.
7515503,eng,How did people know we weren't Canadians?
7730220,eng,I'm pretty sure this is Tom's umbrella.
28242,eng,The committee elected him chairperson.
6244847,eng,Tom will likely be desperate to do that.
3185429,eng,I asked Tom to help me find a place to stay.
10361968,eng,The vehicle was stolen.
6345223,eng,What did Tom think you were doing?
2096547,eng,The king did not see the end of the monarchy coming.
6263366,eng,How often do you go downtown?
4012236,eng,Is that Tom's umbrella?
7166144,eng,Sami was standing in the middle of the road.
273165,eng,It's really fast with a dedicated line.
7519937,eng,I knew that somebody would come.
3738643,eng,Why would I need to do that?
1847718,eng,Tom is at his desk eating a sandwich.
6675828,eng,I suspect that Tom is awake.
10518686,eng,We're trying to weigh all our options before reaching a final decision.
1467809,eng,"Don't worry, go have fun!"
8340273,eng,Tom didn't know how to act.
2111786,eng,I'll cancel.
1536840,eng,You don't like it?
289105,eng,He is always complaining about his low salary.
2615770,eng,Coffee is the holy drink of university students.
6936239,eng,They're insufferable.
2640073,eng,Tom and Mary told us they wouldn't fight anymore.
7387939,eng,She got in her car and drove off.
8478777,eng,Who hugged him?
6107138,eng,Layla was a secretary at a church.
10766746,eng,"We got some weird mail from Amazon. What should I do? ""Just leave it there and don't do anything."""
7400453,eng,"He was unfriendly, wasn't he?"
7398079,eng,She was glad she got there early.
6262682,eng,Tom told Mary that he thought John was tired.
6123078,eng,I think I should've talked to Tom about that.
2952325,eng,I learned a valuable lesson tonight.
266781,eng,"If you give at all, give quickly."
7328092,eng,Shave your beard.
9992409,eng,Yanni noticed a man standing in the middle of the road.
5062140,eng,"By doing that, you make me very happy."
6337770,eng,I can speak French much better than Tom can.
10066842,eng,Japan has countless islands.
3657396,eng,The daisy is white.
10627473,eng,Quite a few people do that.
3724638,eng,Tom made a bad judgment call.
8404391,eng,My cousin is Muslim.
3494656,eng,Poaching is illegal.
71441,eng,I want to know what you did this summer.
3358591,eng,You can always text Tom.
6438539,eng,Tom said that Mary was afraid.
6824061,eng,Sami decided to become a homosexual.
6524771,eng,Do you think that Tom and Mary have both lost weight?
8521903,eng,He never tried to kiss her.
42799,eng,"They are nature's laboratory for all kinds of plant, animal and insect life."
10180206,eng,There are no signs of forced entry.
8549662,eng,Leave the towels here.
2267793,eng,That artist's very popular.
45940,eng,The statesman is worthy of respect.
5227259,eng,Tom is no different than the rest of us.
1257028,eng,I said he could go.
8792733,eng,Yanni thought he was better than anybody else because he knew fashion.
6652884,eng,Tom said he thought that he knew the cause of the accident.
7374409,eng,"Mary is just about finished, isn't she?"
9073318,eng,I heard Tom opening and closing the door.
6253335,eng,Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
5700981,eng,I think we have a good chance of winning.
7134712,eng,I knew I should do something differently.
5265430,eng,Nobody tells the truth anymore.
3832014,eng,Tom died a number of years ago.
7770432,eng,Our plane arrived at 11 a.m.
6497104,eng,Tom and Mary haven't been doing that as often as they should.
320802,eng,Mom spread the table.
10139063,eng,Algeria has been going through turbulent times.
4496688,eng,My children's safety comes first.
6238456,eng,Didn't you know Tom used to work in Boston?
8702849,eng,Arrokoth is one of the thousands of known small icy worlds in the Kuiper Belt.
1164153,eng,Tom will pick the kids up after school.
8503791,eng,That changed my life.
10158065,eng,Yanni was inspired by classical literature.
680726,eng,The teacher wants us to divide the work on this project.
10230766,eng,Ziri proved his point.
6128541,eng,I prefer learning multiple languages at the same time.
2358939,eng,I've always had help.
3594003,eng,That's a real long shot.
8001503,eng,Baya is still Mennad's girlfriend.
1099043,eng,The teacher sits on the chair.
9019769,eng,You will have to start working again.
6579274,eng,Tom loves her to death.
2958303,eng,Tom told me to stop talking.
7246453,eng,Sami won't go into details.
254242,eng,I felt my face turn pale when I heard that sound.
8478557,eng,He's just died.
2543043,eng,I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
6346556,eng,Tom says he didn't agree to do that.
6286976,eng,Cracking your knuckles will give you arthritis.
30207,eng,"I disliked the idea of the necessary call, but it had to be done."
9133774,eng,I only drink tea.
1555352,eng,Flavio is enrolled in his third year of high school.
8477730,eng,He died in bed.
6411054,eng,Mary realized there was no way she'd be able do that.
6809417,eng,Sami came up to Layla and apologized for everything.
3506521,eng,"Do you understand me, Tom?"
5189059,eng,I used to love it when Tom came over to visit.
10532808,eng,Ziri built a shelter for his sheep.
9633085,eng,I find that interesting.
280319,eng,"At the same time, he began to run."
7982014,eng,Sami and Layla both needed weed.
312114,eng,"Since she speaks in French, I can't understand her."
10025900,eng,Mary likes chocolate pudding with custard.
5320401,eng,"When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force."
8508316,eng,It's special.
6560084,eng,Sami threw the key into the river.
7874195,eng,He doesn't live in Kabylie anymore.
9833326,eng,I told Tom that he should stop drinking.
6427786,eng,"Mary is very late, isn't she?"
6663348,eng,I got out of bed and got dressed.
10359545,eng,"When you're chewing something you're eating, it gets mushed into a mass called a bolus, which you then swallow."
6519929,eng,Tom and Mary had bruises on their arms.
8384013,eng,Tom is wearing flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt.
8369550,eng,Tom is obviously miserable.
265428,eng,"My car broke down, so I had to take a bus."
7382757,eng,She spilled coffee on herself.
2642314,eng,Tom said you were good at chess.
6882516,eng,Tom went up the stairs quickly.
1095945,eng,Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
10726670,eng,How many hours of TV do you watch a day?
6227591,eng,It's up to you to decide whether or not Tom has to do that.
10326743,eng,Tom has no right to intervene.
10361204,eng,Tom threw a soaking wet sponge at me at school today.
631178,eng,"They should not wait for help to come to them from elsewhere, or they will be disappointed."
8367521,eng,Tom is always so cheerful.
2543797,eng,I told you not to come here.
9999769,eng,Is Tom OK with this?
3085369,eng,He went from his house up to the railroad station.
7307138,eng,Sami has an abusive mentality.
8351713,eng,Tom was nearly run over by a car.
3736483,eng,I want to know who you're going out with tonight.
6066940,eng,I have a brother who used to be a policeman.
1868180,eng,Tom is not the one who borrowed my car.
1808180,eng,She kicked me out of the house.
8313740,eng,It's going to be hot today in Algiers.
8125549,eng,I want to take a picture of it.
6259361,eng,Tom admitted he did what Mary asked him not to do.
6353597,eng,Tom said Mary didn't want to walk home by herself.
6663119,eng,I don't think Tom is charismatic.
6353367,eng,How long did the storm last?
7172788,eng,I thought that Tom was different.
7403781,eng,She looks like she's unhurt.
8176590,eng,He smells of poo.
1699499,eng,I hope we meet again someday soon.
8533402,eng,Mary is Tom's sugar mama.
3129149,eng,What? It's already 11? I thought it was still 9 o'clock.
10257349,eng,The grass is wet.
6239359,eng,Tom and his wife have adopted three children.
8376762,eng,Tom is a stickler for details.
6633515,eng,Feminism is disgusting.
6661149,eng,"Tom isn't fast, but Mary is."
6342542,eng,"Tom wanted to stay longer, but he couldn't."
8830729,eng,Reading people is a fantastic skill to have.
7409543,eng,They say we can start without them.
7171588,eng,I thought that you needed money.
10107952,eng,This is Yanni's pet peeve.
6260135,eng,Tom will be desperate to do that.
8037444,eng,There's no sugar here.
8180050,eng,Potatoes are cheap.
2788047,eng,Is it so difficult to choose between heaven and hell?
10042996,eng,We've done that all our lives.
6437178,eng,How long have you been here today?
6357221,eng,Tom didn't believe Mary would win.
1094373,eng,Tom doesn't mind walking in the rain.
5860696,eng,I bought some rice.
7859758,eng,I live in the apartment above Tom's.
1954503,eng,You can't leave Boston today.
2664352,eng,She did not believe that I understood her tactics.
8642065,eng,Tom could not catch his breath.
3151544,eng,Give me a hand with this.
5154764,eng,Tom hasn't been sleeping well.
2821062,eng,Tom sensed that something was not quite right.
1961200,eng,"I thought about writing you a message, but never got around to it."
3819161,eng,"My name is Tom, too."
3911683,eng,That was foolish of them.
2854403,eng,We didn't notice our passing youth.
9975233,eng,Yanni is running.
278441,eng,Corporate borrowing from financial institutions is rising due to the low interest rate.
1225464,eng,Here is the latest interview!
3906180,eng,You might want to talk to her.
4918078,eng,Do you want to go and see a film this evening?
8510502,eng,Tom became convinced Mary no longer loved him.
453822,eng,A million people lost their live during the war.
306937,eng,They have been cheated of the best things that life has to offer.
3181119,eng,Do you wanna talk?
9505607,eng,Tom nodded his head slowly.
8034136,eng,I didn't take that bicycle.
243745,eng,I've lost weight recently.
7171983,eng,I thought that you were going to do something about that.
3560945,eng,"How do you know I'm not from here? ""It's obvious."" ""Really?"""
8043008,eng,The Houthi rebels are trained by Iran.
7475394,eng,They oiled their bicycles chains.
1026515,eng,Tom decided to submit his resignation.
9825486,eng,We have a French test on Monday.
242745,eng,How fine it is today.
8588849,eng,My car stalled in the middle of the intersection.
7386628,eng,She's happy with her new job.
731782,eng,Barking dogs don't bite.
8848064,eng,We're not prepared.
2413738,eng,Tom is a teacher of Chinese literature.
5859431,eng,I could've been injured.
1579057,eng,For whom have you brought the bone?
7231926,eng,"I don't think that Tom had to do that, but he did it anyway."
251324,eng,"Don't get smart with me, or you'll get a black eye!"
6221163,eng,Both Tom and I study French.

2737382,eng,Tom has already started eating lunch.
2538391,eng,I'm just going to assume Tom will be here.
10339485,eng,The rumour ultimately turned out to be false.
2537163,eng,I'm starting to think that maybe I shouldn't have come here.
480884,eng,I'll phone you.
6196908,eng,There's still one thing I don't understand.

6873180,eng,I'm playing in the park.
7438706,eng,They said that they were really nervous.
5731935,eng,This could push prices higher.
4017362,eng,Have you been playing basketball all afternoon?
3409394,eng,Tom always walks to school.
5745970,eng,Tom couldn't live with it.
10698573,eng,Where did you get the idea from?
7169794,eng,I think that Tom could get Mary to help you.

9210862,eng,Tom wasn't among the people who came.
8522289,eng,He didn't want to surprise her.
2248783,eng,It may hurt.
10028663,eng,"That's not supposed to happen, is it?"
48269,eng,The dog was so clever that he seemed almost human.
7734900,eng,Tom will come to Boston.

4497954,eng,I thought we did well.
7276175,eng,Layla was the new girl.
3415381,eng,Just say you love me.
7520409,eng,Tom is better-looking than me.
7386159,eng,He sold his car last week.
4013351,eng,How did you get past security?

9687015,eng,What was I thinking about?
2016613,eng,I don't want to live where I work.
5958254,eng,I want to pay later.
3549960,eng,He came even though the weather was bad.

8099597,eng,Do you know any of those men?
6341895,eng,Tom isn't the one who told me how to do that.
7389859,eng,She looked around at her family.
8355067,eng,“Why are you going to town with the car?” – “Because I have an appointment.”
9779581,eng,You're not old enough to drink yet.
6424919,eng,"Mary didn't say anything, did she?"
6293901,eng,"Comet Halley is responsible for depositing the debris that, when falling through Earth's atmosphere, causes the Orionid meteor showers."

10651779,eng,Tom made cornbread.
6415193,eng,Mary told me that she thought Tom was nervous.
10026385,eng,Yanni was singing that song.
4903089,eng,Tom bought an ice cream and sorbet maker.
8636213,eng,There isn't much water in the pond.
3821707,eng,I passed out.
10722333,eng,Tom says that there's a reason he does that.
1518428,eng,"Ready, set, go!"
6410771,eng,Why don't you ask Mary if she'd like to come with us?
10113507,eng,"“The challenge was to pick up 502,000 objects between 28 May and 8 June. In fact we went over that target and have 794,207 pieces,” she said."
7494407,eng,Where did she get that great-looking hat?
7965123,eng,I was in the hospital for three weeks.
6432981,eng,Tom did the same thing I did on Monday evening.
297792,eng,He passed by my house but didn't drop in.
6909145,eng,My significant other and I often go bowling.
7563454,eng,Can you meet with me?
6221425,eng,Tom knows where everyone is.
7471917,eng,Tom and Mary don't look like they're happy.
9419733,eng,He is not happy although he has money.
10696857,eng,Everything is fine between us.
8560898,eng,Algeria is a big economy.
8672732,eng,Tom is not being honest with me.
5392547,eng,I know you're going to do very well.
7818223,eng,"She answered: Dost thou think it a small matter, that thou hast taken my husband from me, unless thou take also my son's mandrakes? Rachel said: He shall sleep with thee this night, for thy son's mandrakes."
60081,eng,The fire reduced the whole village to ashes.
7512679,eng,I didn't know that Tom saw me leaving early.
4497641,eng,Tom said he didn't have a choice.
3417493,eng,Tom left here three hours ago.
17565,eng,I little dreamed of seeing you here.
65586,eng,This condo is getting old. Why don't we redecorate to give it a fresh feel?
2712831,eng,Tom sat at his desk grading papers.
7000282,eng,"Charred remains of a flatbread baked about 14,500 years ago in a stone fireplace at a site in northeastern Jordan have given researchers a delectable surprise: people began making bread, a vital staple food, millennia before they developed agriculture."
7736124,eng,I couldn't hear what Tom was saying.
7851319,eng,I want to visit Kabylie this summer.
9257694,eng,There wasn't much furniture in the room.
9956376,eng,It was super snowy that day.
9816929,eng,I hope you know I love you.
2796061,eng,I don't know if he's dead or alive.
7393227,eng,She said she couldn't accept the job.
7163693,eng,Tom doesn't know why Mary wants him to go to Australia with her.
8546487,eng,How do giraffes mate?
6532003,eng,Tom wanted to know why.
2376275,eng,I know what I heard.
9209165,eng,Tom probably forgot.
10522828,eng,What has Ziri written?
1882355,eng,Where did you sing them?
6932484,eng,Tom and Mary are polyamorous.
6243625,eng,I didn't know that you had so many cats.
6252651,eng,Tom will likely be ready to do that.
6918823,eng,"Tom is Mary's husband, isn't he?"
9501210,eng,There were still three left.
1820829,eng,How many people died in the earthquake?
3497926,eng,"Many people would like to be motivated, innovative, thinking beings if they could only get the opportunity."
9964583,eng,He pitied us.
4700032,eng,Tom would like to come with us.
2267018,eng,I hurt my foot.
2716994,eng,What's the difference between a village and a city?
6529255,eng,Tom always kisses Mary good morning.
8478091,eng,He stood still.
7182364,eng,Tom said that he found doing that hard.
9506846,eng,Both of them left.
7737358,eng,I'm happy with what I'm doing.
1027633,eng,Could you show Tom how to use this application?
327655,eng,I know it myself.
301396,eng,He didn't see anybody.
3312816,eng,We'd better find it soon.
9681987,eng,"You didn't ask Tom to do that, did you?"
4496045,eng,I believed in myself.
10191400,eng,I didn't know that we were fellow countrymen.
2673627,eng,Tom can't write yet.
7146002,eng,I didn't think Tom wanted any help.
10023314,eng,Yanni is one of our former employees.
6496277,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice wasn't sincere.
2546398,eng,Tom knows this is true.
7805181,eng,People are very bad at understanding probability.
2359074,eng,I've been doing some research.
7051010,eng,Step out into the hall. I'd like to speak with you.
2301,eng,Do you have a pen on you?
8801587,eng,Yanni was spending some quality time with his mother.
7400468,eng,She told us she'd study French.
3023453,eng,Tom let Mary play his guitar.
285358,eng,His excellent work stands out.
9150496,eng,Yanni's cat is probably not happy for being in a box.
3736723,eng,My knee hurts a lot.
7879898,eng,I decided to go to Kabylie.
2645798,eng,Tom never speaks to me.
6424092,eng,Mary looked like she was irritated.
7733261,eng,I'm really confused right now.
7856489,eng,Algerian economy is pretty hard to understand.
7272409,eng,Sami stopped kissing Layla.
2270567,eng,Why don't you trust me?
313538,eng,She got up at seven in the morning.
3178465,eng,We have to get rid of Tom.
1548374,eng,We will have guests tomorrow.
319290,eng,Father is well as usual.
2538765,eng,I was in the shower when the phone rang.
7143142,eng,"I didn't want to sell my car, but I needed the money."
9986604,eng,"If this painting were worth half as much as he says, we should have sold it long ago."
3202024,eng,There's so much I need to tell you.
2777631,eng,Tom was only stating the obvious.
9931183,eng,Yanni told his parents about it.
8808664,eng,They took advantage against us.
6107051,eng,Layla fled the scene.
8161128,eng,The out-of-pocket expenses are quite low with my health insurance.
7267575,eng,Sami got nothing done.
7161121,eng,Sami and Layla were in different faculties.
7445164,eng,Tom and Mary told everyone that they were ready.
3347348,eng,You've done very well.
320916,eng,The mother took her child in her arms.
10535000,eng,That was an utter failure.
8905862,eng,"By 2013, the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007."
8534553,eng,Study for your exam.
4999958,eng,We had so much fun.
9388130,eng,Yanni started his search in the basement.
8344987,eng,There were cigarette butts everywhere.
7073096,eng,Tell him to shut his mouth.
7839173,eng,No one needs those low life separatists and their shitty racist propaganda.
8536738,eng,He tried to drown himself in his bathtub.
460189,eng,"It's so hot outside, you could fry an egg."
925455,eng,"Of course, you would eat puddings that are full of proofs, wouldn't you?"
6091319,eng,"My being lives in Night and Desire, my soul is a memory that is in me."
1336437,eng,I haven't gotten around to doing it yet.
6419291,eng,Mary said she thought Tom was happy here.
7976421,eng,Sami didn't want to continue that fight.
274256,eng,We make the total about $50.
3824269,eng,Did you notice Tom's hair?
8760289,eng,"The instrument, known as the Solar Wind Anisotropies, or SWAN, maps the constantly outflowing solar wind in interplanetary space by focusing on a wavelength of ultraviolet light emitted by hydrogen atoms."
6124423,eng,Tell Tom that I'm going to do that today.
10372040,eng,Tom took out his knife and started whittling a piece of wood.
9969763,eng,Tom mistreats his dog.
807154,eng,The Confederate flag was lowered.
6223154,eng,Tom said Mary would do that as well.
9525125,eng,We don't want you to get bored.
8836147,eng,The rose belongs to Theodore.
28283,eng,The committee stayed up late last night trying to work out measures that would please everyone.
10708070,eng,The time came.
3226609,eng,Some people think that hang gliding is a dangerous sport.
4904520,eng,I'm aware of the limits of my knowledge.
7397035,eng,She says she doesn't study French.
2276900,eng,That doesn't sound very promising.
35749,eng,Turn the knob and open the door.
9369241,eng,Can you please speak more slowly?
294863,eng,He expelled the students from the room.
2545797,eng,Tom is a little shocked.
4597474,eng,If we share this cake we shall neither of us have enough.
10031291,eng,Yanni showed concern.
4784161,eng,Tom is used to the work.
6431114,eng,Tom and Mary both will eat lunch with us.
3287374,eng,Tom didn't write anything in his notebook.
6498996,eng,Tom and Mary are saving money so they can buy motorcycles.
8184144,eng,Tom realized that he barely had enough money to buy what he had to buy.
5999552,eng,Parking was a nightmare.
9023699,eng,We drove to the post office.
6248893,eng,I told Tom you'd come to Boston.
6648292,eng,Tom said that he thought Mary would be suspicious.
2870211,eng,Look at all those people.
7543289,eng,Tom is a fairly good chess player.
3149325,eng,Children are very important for the market.
8519636,eng,She handed a small envelope to him.
9954081,eng,Yanni understands that.
4053190,eng,"One day, you will understand."
61826,eng,Did you use to live here?
19018,eng,The professor smiled.
8768664,eng,Are USB drives outdated?
3523618,eng,"It's all, of course, good and well, but where do I come in?"
6503092,eng,I'll soon find out what Tom and Mary have been doing.
247155,eng,Not merely I but also he is invited to the party.
1183896,eng,My daughter wants a kitten.
6307724,eng,"My head is in a whirl, I remarked; ""the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows."""
6267695,eng,I went to a piano recital.
10598901,eng,"I want to show you the raspberry bushes, put a berry on your soft lips and open them with a gentle kiss."
6158594,eng,I'm used to being up until late.
7971117,eng,Tom was chuffed to bits.
6250077,eng,Tom and I'll be doing that on our own.
9982085,eng,We thanked Tom.
10640081,eng,"I've always loved snow, even as a child."
4014097,eng,Does Tom have to do his homework now?
7117979,eng,I didn't have much time so I just quickly scanned the report.
9962973,eng,"If I'd had time, I would've helped you."
9707321,eng,We're confronted with unfairness on a daily basis.
7506450,eng,Tom tried to think of a way that he could help Mary.
7736803,eng,The airport isn't far from here.
8807175,eng,Sea shells have already been used as currency.
6890621,eng,Are you and Tom coming to the party?
8536836,eng,He told me that he was going to kill himself.
6864761,eng,Anyone who wants to leave early may do so.
9959641,eng,It's too loud in the hospital.
6416572,eng,Mary asked if it would be OK if she did that.
320866,eng,The mother told her daughter to put those toys away.
6713341,eng,Where did you buy that T-shirt?
6663962,eng,Tom didn't seem to be as passionate about that as Mary seemed to be.
3248566,eng,I tried to warn her.
9728844,eng,All I wanted to do was sleep.

7440952,eng,They said they'd be here.
3915159,eng,I may have to help her.
5629383,eng,We can understand everything he's saying.
7492901,eng,The money on the desk isn't mine.
7438971,eng,They told me that they were terrified.
3903278,eng,I just had a talk with her.
3444504,eng,Tom isn't as nice as Mary.
7206265,eng,Sami knew Layla was in there.
5101691,eng,"Yes, don't worry!"
3908761,eng,Please tell him that I called.
1394723,eng,He hasn't started soldering the electronic components on the printed circuit board yet.
2095489,eng,Somebody ought to talk to Tom.
10210660,eng,Ziri waved as Rima walked away.
2643458,eng,What're you doing with this?
6511680,eng,Tom and Mary said they didn't know where to go.
6656629,eng,Tom found Mary's contact lens.
7277843,eng,Nobody knew that except Tom.

73406,eng,"During my early teens, I was not always on the best of terms with my parents."
7733118,eng,Tom is still following us.
6810112,eng,Sami ran back to the kicthen.
3424414,eng,You've got better things to do.
8403846,eng,She slept with other men.
1893739,eng,We remain hopeful that Tom will recover.
328918,eng,I'm instinctively bad with children and infants.
7480418,eng,He began heading back to the city.
10553441,eng,Help help take care of these children.
1819377,eng,Tatoeba is the website I use when I don't find enough examples in dictionaries.
1405638,eng,Who will score the first goal tonight?
8184154,eng,I guess that Tom really had to go.
9851656,eng,"Tom survived, even though all the other passengers were killed."
3181789,eng,How did you talk Tom into that?
6334677,eng,Would you like me to turn the lights on?
5295491,eng,How is everybody at home?
2202631,eng,Tom is brilliant.

7404846,eng,He looks like he's hurt.
262526,eng,Beth looked after our dog while we were away.
3727929,eng,I can see how you might think that.
9823976,eng,How do you know if you're in love with somebody?
6507849,eng,I understand why Tom and Mary want to do that.
2965411,eng,This is a little difficult for me to say.
8390748,eng,This is my first time in Algiers.
8957466,eng,Maybe you should come with me.
6130478,eng,I don't know much about linguistics.
9947435,eng,Why don't we talk about what's going to happen?
252852,eng,I look to you for help.
2544785,eng,I'm going to be out today.
7402420,eng,She helps out any way she can.
308491,eng,"When she returned to her room, the diamond ring was gone."
1096360,eng,Thanks for coming on such short notice.
6821891,eng,I never had a chance to talk to Tom.
7252390,eng,Sami was on his way back.
9458558,eng,I knew something good was about to happen.

6239786,eng,Tom says he doesn't intend to do that again.
7212079,eng,Tom told me he thought that Mary wouldn't be able to do that.

3911792,eng,We'll notify her.
289692,eng,He came as lately as yesterday.
5639086,eng,Tom ignored all my warnings.
5506448,eng,Call me after you get back home.
6504146,eng,It wouldn't surprise me if Tom and Mary don't come.
7377005,eng,Mary tried to control her emotions.
5166480,eng,It doesn't rain very much around here.
2323253,eng,I don't think you should call Tom.
1125794,eng,It's a catchy song.
5193526,eng,I want to see you after lunch.
1024374,eng,Tom often makes mistakes.

3911514,eng,We must get rid of her.
6807451,eng,Sami didn't say anything.
2360386,eng,I've taught Tom everything I know.
3513530,eng,Put your best foot forward.
681733,eng,Please place your coat on the chair.
3910224,eng,We might never see them again.
8526298,eng,"He's there, isn't he?"
5437166,eng,There is no middle ground between these two options.
6434747,eng,I have lots of other things I need to do.
6482265,eng,You'll soon get accustomed to living here.
680182,eng,The Bill of Rights amended the U.S. Constitution.
4498592,eng,That felt so good.
10665751,eng,I love making you smile like this.
6424863,eng,Mary is absent because she's sick.
10234876,eng,Ziri got home from the store.

8302457,eng,She never talks to me.
6417103,eng,Mary isn't really sure what she needs to do.
5541714,eng,She would do anything for you.
6266612,eng,Tom is likely to be sarcastic.
10073902,eng,Don't think I don't know what you're doing.
1650508,eng,"Please, don't forget to close the door of the meeting room."
5726129,eng,We used to have our own servants.
7965143,eng,There are things that can't be left to chance.
8935413,eng,I think I understand you now.
3312098,eng,We'll take care of ourselves.
6503445,eng,Tom and Mary were hoping they could help John do that.
1390406,eng,Yesterday I went to the Goethe-Institut in Bologna with my mother to ask for information about their German courses.
6228520,eng,I'm fairly certain that Tom doesn't know how to do that.
10704659,eng,We sold them at cost.
289412,eng,He was brought up by his uncle.
7095839,eng,Living below your means is the secret to getting rich.
6658243,eng,I don't see any reason why I should do that.

8007404,eng,Mennad wanted to stop living.
9921819,eng,This car was bought last year from someone; it had cost a fortune.
6518284,eng,Do Tom and Mary want the same thing?
7476407,eng,They finished their dessert.
9967389,eng,Yanni is working with that tool.
1951601,eng,I can't figure out what happened.
6646240,eng,Tom told me Mary wouldn't be here.
8021746,eng,I went to law school.
6521722,eng,Tom and Mary played with their kids.
5088480,eng,You should learn to play an instrument.
6698643,eng,I'll buy whatever Tom tells me to.
6353186,eng,Tom said he didn't have to worry about Mary anymore.
2013598,eng,I want to thank you for that.
1776906,eng,What would you like to be when you grow up?
2063668,eng,"Waiter, may I please have the check?"
8517692,eng,I think that you need some time off.
8995560,eng,I didn't know that. Sorry!
7983609,eng,Sami peed in his office.
7384807,eng,She did her part.
8555306,eng,"In the United States, there are five empty homes for every homeless person."
8617353,eng,"I have visited Morocco, Tunisia, and Mauritania. Algeria is next."
9115969,eng,"Tom isn't listening now, is he?"
8233270,eng,He has always been married.
7278345,eng,Sami was trying to find happiness.
6335314,eng,Tom knew it would be difficult to win.
8460518,eng,Ideas matter.
7252439,eng,Sami doesn't really know that branch of the family.
2317499,eng,I don't know how to deal with this.
19048,eng,The teachers are trying to motivate their students.
7381672,eng,"Mary is a coach, isn't she?"
6345722,eng,I learned to do that three years ago.
8586725,eng,Tom punished his children for doing that.
9173524,eng,I could never do it again.
1542075,eng,I can't do anything else. I'm sorry.
2695870,eng,He's cute but stupid.
6770310,eng,There's a policeman outside.
5859403,eng,I drank some water.
8191505,eng,"On the other side of the street, there are no houses yet."
2334873,eng,The odor of dirty socks makes me gag.
3287031,eng,It had nothing to do with that.
1096400,eng,It'll take some time to finish unloading the truck.
10213768,eng,Ziri was Rima's first-born.
6425440,eng,Mary loved the book Tom gave her.
289386,eng,He was the first man that climbed Mount Everest.
5040138,eng,There's a crack in the cup so the contents are leaking.
6445726,eng,Sami's parents told him that all Muslims were terrorists.
6355262,eng,I should've slept longer.
2099835,eng,"Samples are acquired from an analog-to-digital converter at interrupt level and written to one of two ping-pong buffers. When one buffer fills, the interrupt handler switches to the other and sets a flag for the full buffer to be written to disk."
7402605,eng,She told me she's frightened.
7137788,eng,Tom's parents still support him.
3559962,eng,"Here, let me help."
9956218,eng,Yanni has a traumatic brain injury.
9081510,eng,Yanni lives in a rundown apartment in Algiers.
7393226,eng,He said he couldn't accept the job.
7136902,eng,I'm glad we decided to do this.
8516454,eng,He picked up a rock and threw it at her.
10560970,eng,Tom needs to get his life in order.
6589808,eng,I had a dream that I was an amoeba in a pond.
243172,eng,Business failures are down 10% this year.
274068,eng,"Soon ripe, soon rotten."
65226,eng,The engine would not start.
2030093,eng,"You don't want to get me in trouble, do you?"
8459880,eng,How much is a ticket to Tokiponatown?
3663277,eng,We have what we deserve.
3361839,eng,He disposes of them instantly.
6709393,eng,Panicked swimmers often try to counter a rip current by swimming straight back to shore—putting themselves at risk of drowning because of fatigue.
308528,eng,I had almost finished my work when she came.
2688171,eng,Put that back on the table.
6454736,eng,Can you give me another pillow?
3916916,eng,I'll never ever forget her.
5520683,eng,I knew Tom wouldn't do it properly.
2846097,eng,The pen is on the desk.
5186959,eng,A great treasure was discovered in a sunken ship.
8023873,eng,Who's your godmother?
8058664,eng,Mennad is not scared of Baya.
5726570,eng,Can you give me some background on Tom?
7732249,eng,Tom is making coffee in the kitchen.
2262535,eng,Tom goes to church every Sunday.
6429212,eng,Mary lives with her aunt.
2301307,eng,I can see how that would be confusing.
5746709,eng,I think you're off base.
9725835,eng,This sort of thing won't help.
6646046,eng,You look like you aren't having a good time.
7178848,eng,Tom said that Mary is going to eat dinner with us.
9481051,eng,I'll go cycling even if it's raining.
5697173,eng,"Dude, you got to come see this."
9821825,eng,That's how a lot of us feel.
8519388,eng,She might want to talk to him.
8365967,eng,They were selling refrigerators.
7199203,eng,Sami wondered why Layla was doing that.
8869464,eng,Is there something else you would like me to bring you?
6102478,eng,Aren't you going to buy that?
3906279,eng,I'm not going to talk to them.
7020225,eng,Now comes the mystery!
321697,eng,I can wait no longer.
3903588,eng,I've been hanging out with her.
9045969,eng,I never knew that Tom was from Boston.
276341,eng,Who wrote a letter?
6772793,eng,Tom doesn't know the difference between a virus and a bacteria.
931537,eng,Three cubed makes twenty-seven.
48896,eng,The band entertained the spectators at the parade.
714763,eng,Rousseau was mad but influential; Hume was sane but had no followers.
6262414,eng,Tom didn't know whether Mary was happy or not.
7999795,eng,Mennad wanted to be single.
4644966,eng,Hello! Can you hear me?
10287887,eng,I've sprained my ankle several times.
2789256,eng,I prefer the vizier's well-intentioned lie to your malicious truth.
6421801,eng,Mary knew that Tom had a crush on her.
3331077,eng,You'll do just fine.
7180153,eng,Tom said that he's amused by what's going on.
3984105,eng,Tom got a brochure on budget getaways to plan a holiday for himself and Mary.
6008254,eng,I'll wait a week.
8521285,eng,He decided to help her.
3342250,eng,I got Tom to do that for me.
6660352,eng,What was in the envelope that Tom gave you?
10120515,eng,What's Algeria's strategy to dealing with this?
10214246,eng,Ziri was walking around.
10223419,eng,Ziri doesn't want to talk to Rima now.
7963098,eng,I'm an urbanite.
7386023,eng,He said his life was in danger.
9419347,eng,The newspaper hasn't published your article yet.
5853264,eng,I'll do whatever it takes to keep our customers satisfied.
5823290,eng,She's with Jamal.
6867150,eng,Sami had an affair with his boss.
9800945,eng,Did you enjoy the philosophy class?
3204306,eng,"So tell me, how many of these do you want?"
6583902,eng,"Shhhh, I'm reading."
5012736,eng,Hard work doesn't always lead to success.
2245368,eng,Don't stand there.
3908204,eng,What would you tell them?
5956017,eng,I can't go to work today because I'm sick.
10097611,eng,Someone knocked on the front door.
7501589,eng,The only reason Tom didn't do that was because Mary asked him not to.
6562271,eng,I don't have a way with words.
6347808,eng,I didn't know Tom was so upset.
249019,eng,We were more or less disappointed about the election.
10682284,eng,I don't cook as well as Tom does.
2276196,eng,I don't see the point.
5036283,eng,Chinese people are so inscrutable.
2032,eng,I've changed my website's layout.
5848298,eng,Tom swims with his son every morning.
5636109,eng,Let people live peacefully!
9101197,eng,All we need is a little luck.
7449301,eng,Why does she always ask so many questions?
6439364,eng,Tom will come live with us.
2953635,eng,We have almost the same climate here as they do in Boston.
10681947,eng,"Can I have a word with you outside, Tom? ""You can speak to me here. Let's all hear it."""
10624336,eng,"Tom is in the front yard, playing with the dog."
1028362,eng,Tom let Mary pay the bill.
7240913,eng,I didn't know that that would embarrass you.
4256507,eng,My patience is coming to an end.
5736440,eng,The school is taking action.
9049360,eng,A representation is not the thing represented.
8540832,eng,One of my majors is Berber literature.
10124060,eng,We go to bed late on weekends.
6268358,eng,How often do you buy eggs?
10114957,eng,This task is the icing on my cake.
7637287,eng,What is a basher?
7511255,eng,Why didn't you tell me Tom wanted to do that?
6248643,eng,I didn't know that you owned a truck.
7953153,eng,Tom hanged himself yesterday.
7395812,eng,She said that she was feeling fine.
5008961,eng,We only won one game.
9488127,eng,How do you like the wine?
4501736,eng,History is repeating itself.
3428411,eng,Tom is very foolish.
10113580,eng,Tom didn't introduce Mary to any of his friends.
6284877,eng,I thought he was out of his mind.
31211,eng,We think that there should be no more wars.
7393841,eng,He told me that he'd do that soon.
9795924,eng,He is already close to finishing the thick book he is reading.
6246975,eng,I think Tom isn't going to resign.
9448005,eng,Was it a mission that was supposed to be completed?
4748887,eng,I finished the work finally.
9501467,eng,Tom doesn't respect anything or anyone.
10326222,eng,Tom's garden is a lot larger than Mary's.
6528643,eng,Tom wanted to learn some French songs.
6495613,eng,"Tom and Mary expected John to disagree with them, but he didn't."
5755125,eng,We really miss Tom.
7515125,eng,I know that Tom is afraid of Mary's dog.
6774678,eng,Do you still go to church every Sunday?
4015039,eng,Are you sure Tom can do it?
2725709,eng,We are very happy to receive a message from you.
10012952,eng,"Although there has been some progress, most of the press have reported that negotiations have not produced any results in the short time available."
6666417,eng,Tom taught French in Boston before moving to Chicago.
8808471,eng,The lambs were killed by a wolf.
7120306,eng,Tom and Mary are unbiased.
9800641,eng,Yanni appeared to be bleeding from the head profusely.
10023683,eng,Yanni will be alright.
240987,eng,"He brought me coffee, when I had asked for tea."
8508507,eng,It's been terrific.
9797273,eng,Yanni went to the grocery store in the mall.
10327531,eng,We need to be careful. It may be a trap.
4190391,eng,Tom is a child prodigy.
6257605,eng,Tom warned me not to speak French.
275445,eng,The typhoon has lost its power.
4102895,eng,We all die in the end.
5095072,eng,Would that I had met you then.
7327796,eng,I am not old.
6518314,eng,Do Tom and Mary need to leave today?
22040,eng,Watch your step when going down the stairs.
9142142,eng,"Ramming speed, captain!"
6654212,eng,Tom said that he doesn't know where Mary bought her bicycle.
7171658,eng,I thought you said that Tom wasn't here.
6071694,eng,Tom says he's considering getting a dog.
927656,eng,For me it is not yet known.
295014,eng,He is not such a man as to flinch from danger.
7991989,eng,Sami did whatever he wanted throughout the day.
9458924,eng,Yanni spent a nice holiday in Algeria.
10054963,eng,Enjoy yourself while you can.
802604,eng,They felt he had no chance to win the election.
6411807,eng,I hope that Mary likes the present I bought for her.
1723297,eng,He comes every day to visit his sick friend.
4494146,eng,"Tom was, of course, happy."
6653414,eng,Tom said that he knew where Mary lived.
2544415,eng,I thought you might change.
6524836,eng,Both Tom and Mary were very sleepy.
305649,eng,They often make fun of the boss.
1095488,eng,Tom certainly doesn't need Mary's help.
6666795,eng,Tom asked me if I could help Mary.
2774088,eng,Mix this powder with a cup of water.
2369527,eng,"Who're you talking to, fool?"
8352189,eng,The situation has gotten worse since then.
7475216,eng,They did only what they had to do.
680462,eng,We need this report by tomorrow.
9192979,eng,Tom has already read it.
10457351,eng,Call!
5375022,eng,That's a big step.
9793703,eng,Don't leave me here all alone.
5178631,eng,Let's try to win every game.
4009474,eng,Dan looked out the window and saw Linda coming.
5376410,eng,It was really nice chatting with you.
2544542,eng,Tom sat down at the piano.
2957427,eng,Tom knows who broke the window.
8553589,eng,Tom hasn't taken a bath in three days.
6242496,eng,I didn't choose the same thing Tom did.
3826449,eng,Tom doesn't want to go away.
319483,eng,There were a lot of people in the room.
432849,eng,My wife asked me to throw this old hat away.
10726593,eng,He has just bought a used moped.
7165388,eng,Sami is my previous landlord.
3909435,eng,Why didn't somebody stop him?
238846,eng,It will pay you to save a part of your salary each month.
7819780,eng,"Since I wrote the report in a hurry, it had many mistakes."
3909182,eng,I'll take him there myself.
8826666,eng,"No one had really understood, but everyone nodded as if it was all totally clear."
10025769,eng,What time do you think you're likely to get here?
5937255,eng,I'm not old enough to go to school.
8185387,eng,"Employers often value experience more than academics, such as a college major or grades."
9194674,eng,Will you come eat tomorrow?
6529881,eng,Tom wanted to tell you something.
8023855,eng,Who's going to speak tonight?
10172138,eng,Tom's father told him to wash his face.
4664046,eng,I haven't seen Tom for almost a year.
5744701,eng,"That was true for Tom, too."
8748627,eng,I am scared.
6497293,eng,I don't think Tom and Mary know exactly what they have to do.
6251033,eng,Perhaps there's no need to do that.
8001550,eng,Mennad is so depressed.
4627352,eng,Why am I so nervous?
7814761,eng,"There are words in Portuguese that don't have translation or equivalence in other languages like ""açaí"", ""samba"" or ""guaraná""."
6244711,eng,"You didn't let Tom do that, did you?"
1961257,eng,I thought I recognized this car.
3155616,eng,Put the kettle on.
2786000,eng,How do you avoid getting sweat in your eyes?
3083580,eng,"We would have told you, but we needed your reactions to look genuine."
10168292,eng,"Tom? Tom Jackson? ""The very same."""
7734942,eng,"Tom is a child psychologist, isn't he?"
2611783,eng,She is too tired to work.
3731869,eng,Is it money you want?
2995414,eng,Why would anybody do that?
7494061,eng,Where did Tom end up going?
6768347,eng,You have to be crazy to keep denying such an irrefutable truth!
10180308,eng,I forced Tom to go.
2539694,eng,I'm waiting for the light to change.
7170587,eng,I knew that Tom wouldn't fail his French test.
5682076,eng,Tom and Mary tried to catch snowflakes on their tongues.
6653145,eng,Tom said that he probably wouldn't be busy on Monday.
7242550,eng,Sami did it once.
7981979,eng,Sami withdrew money from an ATM at the club.
8535550,eng,"She offered to carry his suitcase, but he told her he wanted to carry it himself."
2891917,eng,That wasn't one of the choices.
1225663,eng,I don't know what love is.
1313066,eng,Doctors and hospitals should help everyone.
8232449,eng,He thinks he's doing big things.
9805607,eng,What are three interesting things about you that I wouldn’t know from your application?
6657376,eng,I don't eat desserts unless I make them myself.
2820683,eng,"Pay attention to details, and you'll get along all right."
10743139,eng,Our purpose is to make learning Arabic free and easy.
3986173,eng,What's the mistake?
4013249,eng,It's not as crazy as it sounds.
6655269,eng,Tom said he assumed that you would want to do that.
4529704,eng,I assume that's what you want.
7501991,eng,I knew that Tom would tell you how to do that if you asked him to.
9394433,eng,Tom bought some fertilizer.
6690019,eng,I'm mad at Tom for doing that.
10666531,eng,"I don't know all of the 160,000 headwords of this dictionary either."
9182700,eng,Hi to those over there.
243501,eng,We went into the woods in search of insects.
7777579,eng,She isn't Anna?
3722965,eng,"I'm sorry, I know I was out of line."
6814391,eng,I know what Tom ate for lunch.
437029,eng,I want the bigger cake.
3726139,eng,Tom clearly wants to help.
7266155,eng,Sami was scanning the backyard.
6261993,eng,Tom seemed to be surprised when Mary did that.
6338586,eng,"I knew I had to tell Tom the truth, but I didn't want to."
6354720,eng,Did you take any pictures?
3873503,eng,This is the first time I've seen such a big strawberry.
7519241,eng,Tom bought a blue scarf for Mary.
7471128,eng,Tom and Mary swore they wouldn't ever do that.
6466652,eng,The two pubescent boys hacked the public-service announcement system and warned of a fifty-foot giant woman approaching the town.
7129962,eng,Tom is likely going to be difficult to get along with.
8515931,eng,He said that he wanted to sit next to her.
2951842,eng,Everyone remained seated.
8185738,eng,I didn't realize that you were serious.
5937798,eng,We must never forget the inherent value of every human being.
6098976,eng,Some think there are too many foreigners; I think there are too few.
7179345,eng,Tom said that it was a beautiful day.
5758407,eng,"After you, Tom."
7258763,eng,Sami pays his co-workers to work shifts for him.
295797,eng,He is the last man to take a bribe.
4664662,eng,Don't mention this matter to Tom.
6353142,eng,I said I'll do that for you.
9888658,eng,That was the best solution for us two.
4703059,eng,The street is empty.
10622080,eng,He's always been a reasonable guy.
7126221,eng,Tom is likely to be astonished.
1887108,eng,I can now die a happy man.
4233773,eng,What makes you smile?
6646393,eng,Tom told me that Mary has always done that that way.
7443488,eng,They told us they could win.
5895530,eng,Layla saw Fadil as a patsy with a wallet.
5915302,eng,Tom's mother helps him with his homework.
8509885,eng,Tom enjoyed the story Mary told him and the other children.
7112686,eng,I had a good mentor in Boston.
7932318,eng,Can I talk to you about something that's bothering me?
6111885,eng,Layla was shivering all the time.
6520265,eng,Tom and Mary took off their raincoats.
9683920,eng,You'll take your chances.
8054878,eng,Mennad worked till six o'clock.
9756084,eng,Tom sped up.
6497821,eng,I wish I'd done what Tom and Mary said they wanted me to do.
7245536,eng,Sami had assignments he had to finish up before class.
3738389,eng,What more can we offer?
2376601,eng,I know you think highly of Tom.
1498100,eng,"As soon as I entered the class, the students started asking questions."
509515,eng,"Suffering from terminal cancer, he was thrown out of a certain veteran hospital in New York three times because he adamantly rejected blood transfusions."
3737608,eng,Tom thought that Mary would be at John's party.
7152602,eng,They're still in Australia.
3327462,eng,Can you answer me?
1087053,eng,I saw a shape in the dark.
6243837,eng,Tom said he was tired of giving speeches.
7199902,eng,Tom couldn't fulfill the promise he made to his grandfather.
6227824,eng,I think Tom would like to be outside playing with the other children.
6507963,eng,I hope Tom and Mary know who wants to do that.
2011459,eng,Who wants to fight?
8558168,eng,The El Harrach river is still badly polluted.
2926308,eng,I said something.
7522337,eng,I know Tom didn't know we had to do that.
8305811,eng,She has been having lesbian encounters.
7164850,eng,Sami worked there for six hours.
6687711,eng,I'm not likely be punished for doing that.
1643204,eng,The wind still blows strongly.
8629730,eng,"In France, a fresh baguette is considered as necessary as medicine."
10223387,eng,Ziri has friends who love him.
10157376,eng,Spices such as cloves came from the renowned Spice Islands.
6513318,eng,Do you know why Tom and Mary were hiding?
2622032,eng,"When I saw his face, I was instantly on red alert."
284309,eng,He will blow our party.
2396073,eng,I didn't want you to get involved.
6433279,eng,I don't think Tom would like it if I did that.
6253907,eng,I bet it's pretty easy to do that.
6973370,eng,He had never seen her laugh.
4496334,eng,Tom was caught stealing.
8642083,eng,"“It was shortly after he got to the hospital that we got a text. He tested positive for COVID,” Armstrong said."
1756068,eng,Never believe the mass media.
6089187,eng,I'd like to know who did that.
8536013,eng,She isn't planning to do that by herself.
7165902,eng,Sami felt that the house was haunted.
2050566,eng,Are you ready to play?
10185323,eng,"On a scale of ""gringo"" to ""mero mero sabor ranchero"", how good is my Spanish?"
2642423,eng,Tom and Mary have been arrested.
3735835,eng,Tom taught me many things.
7376130,eng,Mary told her son to behave himself.
6033371,eng,I kicked the door in.
7403488,eng,He says he needs it today.
10232949,eng,Ziri continued to dig.
10724887,eng,Maybe I should stay up a bit longer.
6027727,eng,Where is the waiting room?
8101746,eng,Tom can read more than 100 pages per hour.
4665339,eng,I don't believe it's possible.
284002,eng,He sent me a birthday card.
3724893,eng,"Don't rub it in, Tom."
6402598,eng,I have a pot of oregano plant in my bedroom.
1096198,eng,I think Tom could accomplish just about anything he decides to do.
1867805,eng,Tom walked over to the desk.
682404,eng,My house is on the west side of the street.
7800208,eng,I think we'd better wait another thirty minutes.
1590845,eng,I would like to thank you in advance for the information.
7150269,eng,You should've stayed in Australia longer.
5512058,eng,"The investigator wants to know who did what to whom where, when, and why."
7227241,eng,Do you think that there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
6253658,eng,I don't ever want to leave Boston.
1024816,eng,Tom is the same age as I am.
10222863,eng,Ziri is busy today.
7544585,eng,"I'm in love with you, Tom."
3462753,eng,You are a magical being who radiates with light.
5936976,eng,Tom raised Mary as his own daughter.
3092529,eng,You did exactly what Tom wanted you to do.
8601879,eng,How am I supposed to know?
6235496,eng,I didn't want to know what was going to happen.
1513863,eng,You'll have to learn all these dates by rote.
7321595,eng,Sami is trying to film.
2474796,eng,I would like to have cleaner teeth!
3426263,eng,Tom gave his mother everything he earned.
47055,eng,The fact seemed to irritate her husband.
8792432,eng,Yanni said inappropriate things to Skura.
9638557,eng,That's a strange way to run a business.
10719030,eng,"If you play with fire, you'll get burned."
2361542,eng,I don't want to be called crazy.
3619367,eng,I have a feeling I'm going to really like living in Boston.
3573975,eng,How many times are you going to do that?
262943,eng,We may be late for school.
3240567,eng,Do you remember the first time you kissed me?
3431282,eng,Tom knows exactly what he's doing.
2903777,eng,She must have seen me.
7735364,eng,How many times have you done that today?
3374139,eng,I have a wife.
31219,eng,You should get yourself a new car now.
7235398,eng,She'll probably never forgive me.
6695644,eng,That magazine isn't interesting or anything like that.
8976179,eng,Hand it over to me.
3199759,eng,Tom went to a family reunion last weekend.
5395117,eng,Tom agreed to meet with Mary.
7999870,eng,Mennad was still freaked out.
247465,eng,There is a big park near our school.
238676,eng,Friendship is as precious as anything else.
9525722,eng,Tom stepped over the toolbox.
663780,eng,We know that you're superficial enough to be happy about this gift.
2091098,eng,No one is around.
7442152,eng,"Tom and Mary were very friendly, weren't they?"
6111060,eng,Where does Tom want to work?
28530,eng,"Talk of devil, and he's presently at your elbow."
5737215,eng,I never celebrate successes.
249476,eng,We will have lived in Kyoto for eight years next March.
3368826,eng,Tom is a politician who must be prepared to swallow a lot of the words he said earlier.
7149292,eng,Why do you think Tom doesn't like Australia?
10530100,eng,What happens to people when they die?
10096668,eng,Yanni got a little shy at Skura's remarks.
7114556,eng,I think it's an honor.
255003,eng,I beat him at chess.
10457494,eng,There's no point in complaining.
2466814,eng,It's not even true.
2550028,eng,"Take this one, for example."
10367138,eng,The day before yesterday was Saturday.
1029331,eng,Tom didn't expect such a nice present from Mary.
10186152,eng,Yanni did not shed a single tear.
8588222,eng,Tom pulled off his sweater.
4132627,eng,His memory is deteriorating with age.
10075516,eng,"I died yesterday, and I'm coming back to haunt you."
2951229,eng,My dog is scared of the booming of New Year's Eve's fireworks and the poor thing has been hiding under the sofa for several hours already.
5189233,eng,I'm not used to this kind of stuff.
6650286,eng,Tom said that he didn't think that he ought to do that.
6660565,eng,I don't think Tom will be coming in this morning.
6102437,eng,I don't have the courage to say that to him.
10083960,eng,Nothing is impossible for me.
6356043,eng,You should be a tailor.
21490,eng,I like summer holidays better than school.
6940536,eng,Some of Africa's oldest baobab trees have died suddenly.
5824798,eng,Tom has a crush on his teacher.
6355375,eng,I don't think Tom knows why Mary is scared.
7123122,eng,Tom and Mary should be friends.
10006415,eng,Tom was very thankful.
7396527,eng,She didn't know what she was doing.
6224398,eng,Both Tom and I can play chess quite well.
8341025,eng,Tom doesn't like coffee at all.
7405503,eng,He said he didn't win.
2259868,eng,What have you got there in your pocket?
2361116,eng,I don't believe Tom is the killer.
7242548,eng,Sami is yelling and screaming.
3382706,eng,"Oh my God, Mary has done it!"
7473175,eng,They say that they don't like to do that.
57822,eng,How long is this?
8340786,eng,Tom didn't seem to want to hold Mary's hand.
7472829,eng,They said that they hope that that'll happen soon.
6086692,eng,Layla threw a blanket over Sami's body.
632055,eng,"Sentence Number 888,888 will bring its owner years of happiness."
2249025,eng,It's almost empty.
6430650,eng,No one kisses Tom anymore.
9977834,eng,Yanni is a vicar.
10751339,eng,I've got to leave.
3591693,eng,That's the choice I made.
4740672,eng,You have to audition to join the choir.
8382372,eng,Tom left his children behind.
6470274,eng,I wonder if it will be fun...
5441789,eng,That was somebody else's idea.
264487,eng,Two people riding on a bicycle at the same time is dangerous.
9366384,eng,Are you warming up to me?
10520495,eng,"The platypus is an animal, found in Australia, which is both a mammal and an oviparous ""duck""."
5832825,eng,You want it? Come get it.
4203496,eng,The bar was so crowded you could hardly move.
4012114,eng,It'll be like a vacation.
5930301,eng,Foreigners are very intolerant.
7242763,eng,"This time, the nuclear test failed."
427700,eng,Seeing a white lilly is splendid.
2265508,eng,It is a result.
328427,eng,"By summit, do you mean the Group of Eight?"
6242980,eng,People hear only what they want to hear.
6428503,eng,Mary says she's got a cold.
9480647,eng,Tell Tom how Mary was dressed.
6110419,eng,I still don't want to do that.
5366207,eng,Only one student stayed after class to talk to the teacher.
7708225,eng,Tom is getting really mad.
2646524,eng,That wasn't difficult.
9024117,eng,He hurt his leg while playing football.
3135671,eng,I'm almost sure that isn't the way it happened.
7399450,eng,She told me she was coming back.

8585421,eng,I realized Tom wasn't laughing and wondered what was wrong.
10779472,eng,Surely you jest.
8525384,eng,She returned his book to him.
8928624,eng,I'm sick of traveling.
8279053,eng,You can smoke a decoder if you are not careful.
1514228,eng,Fish surface for air.
5225002,eng,The main idea of the book relied on a false premise.
6897877,eng,I thought that Tom would change his mind.
7198749,eng,It isn't a pyramid scheme.
3903310,eng,"You're staying with her, right?"
4664188,eng,I think it's time for an oil change.
3396675,eng,Do you know what's in that box?
10212387,eng,He asked me to say hello.
7181093,eng,Tom had to return to Australia.

9819388,eng,Mary kissed him on the mouth.

2266091,eng,He bowed his head.
9008233,eng,Yanni opened the safe.
7421630,eng,You did an awesome job.
6898479,eng,I'll lend you this pen.
6796683,eng,What's the capital of Australia?
6084069,eng,Please write your telephone number here.
10475379,eng,Do you have a chisel that I could borrow?
8526020,eng,He's eating by himself.
6498437,eng,I think Tom and Mary might get hurt if they try to do that.
8478896,eng,He curses a lot.
249175,eng,We love him all the more because he is honest.
10078240,eng,How will Algeria be in ten years from now?
4005418,eng,"A mule is a hybrid offspring of two species, a female horse and a male donkey."

5916528,eng,Tom is better at skiing than me.
5455849,eng,"If you have an idea, go for it and just do it."
10191384,eng,"I sit and sort out foreign words, like digging a well with a needle."
10314983,eng,Every minute is precious.

7397037,eng,She says she doesn't speak French.
7426739,eng,We've decided to adopt your idea.
9724929,eng,They think that'll help the economy.
6249192,eng,Why didn't you need to go to Boston?
7020131,eng,Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.
5928093,eng,Sami's greed was satisfied.
6206005,eng,That lawyer has the reputation of being an ambulance chaser.
10473150,eng,"The Romans built their hard-surfaced, paved ""highway"" primarily for military reasons."
4499483,eng,I wasn't aware that Tom wasn't at school today.

7202052,eng,Sami found this so fucking annoying.
6649824,eng,Tom said that he hoped that Mary would be able to learn how to do that.
7230096,eng,I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to get a visa.
3826916,eng,Where were you yesterday afternoon?
2092620,eng,Is there anybody left?
2956741,eng,"Tom fooled everybody, including me."
6128511,eng,Being bald's not so bad.
7165869,eng,Sami called his imaginary friend Farid.
10231427,eng,Ziri is here for the package.
3724315,eng,Tom forced himself to speak.
7184127,eng,I doubt that Tom will ever do that again.
7989955,eng,Sami always says this in his videos.

2821513,eng,Tom asked Mary for money.

10624451,eng,Go and play outside.
7382297,eng,Mary loves her son.
7521716,eng,I think this is the end.
3536386,eng,Did you really threaten to kill Tom?
3911850,eng,I need him to vouch for me.
7389873,eng,He looked at his notepad.
2832259,eng,Did you say a tea party at your place this Sunday?
6599034,eng,"No matter which diet you choose, limiting your intake of carbohydrates is always a good idea."
10357590,eng,That's an uncommon enough name.
6665912,eng,I went to the supermarket to buy some things for Tom.
8192774,eng,Please fill out the whole form below.
823527,eng,The black one is mine.
3725463,eng,Let's see if we can pry this door open.
9801177,eng,Yanni is here with Skura.
3131616,eng,"Whatever happens, don't open that door."
2766192,eng,You are a good man.
9291649,eng,Our team consists of five people.
302579,eng,He regretted borrowing the book from her.

6235050,eng,Tom is one of the thirty people who were arrested.
8979285,eng,Tom is said to live from hand to mouth.
1178280,eng,Tell him to call me tomorrow at noon.
3764904,eng,I still can't get my head around what genius thought this was a good idea.
6665213,eng,I'll play the guitar for you.
5092303,eng,We understood each other.
6124482,eng,Tom and Mary are planning to go to Boston together.
6231789,eng,Doing that the way Tom suggested would be more fun.
6346069,eng,I'm sure Tom won't eat that much?
8988506,eng,Tom is probably not going to have to go to Boston next week.
3258969,eng,We need to smile often.
5945079,eng,Let's just pretend this didn't happen.
10685259,eng,"Read the work ""Popular Deities in Chinese Buddhism (Illustrated)."""
8679958,eng,Plants are thirsty.

8818686,eng,Yanni turned the music down.
9826463,eng,Tom wasn't able to figure out how to get the box open.
8340979,eng,What a fantastic view!
3732494,eng,Tom was obviously very disappointed.
6716191,eng,I asked Tom if anybody was in the classroom.
7162814,eng,"He reached the level of non-commissioned officer in the army, but didn't have a college degree so he could go no higher."
7899809,eng,"Denis is the boss, yet he still makes polite requests for the performance of tasks by his employees, maybe even thanking them for their work. The workers respect him."
1142322,eng,Only an audacious mind will be able to solve this riddle.
306678,eng,They have charged me 30 pounds for the shoes.
5901310,eng,My imagination is without limit.
9280870,eng,Skura is Yanni's big sister.
9836686,eng,We need to study this matter more carefully.
6664040,eng,I didn't think Tom would be so brave.
8522130,eng,He dreamed about kissing her.
2271352,eng,Don't thank me now.
6520157,eng,I asked Tom and Mary if they were busy.
2485028,eng,Tom was the only one who knew about it.
8526232,eng,"He's late, isn't he?"
6254322,eng,You may eat wherever you want to.
9957463,eng,That teacher was always easy to approach for advice.
3907685,eng,No one threatened them.
246986,eng,Is there any room for me?
8232890,eng,"Reading Tatoeba sentences, I sometimes have déjà vu."
3911665,eng,I wasn't making fun of him.
300937,eng,He says his son can count up to 100 now.
3110604,eng,My grandson's toys are spread all around the house.
2406383,eng,I should've been more thorough.
8041305,eng,Don't drink like that.
7276482,eng,Eat less to become slim.
6434503,eng,Tom tried to prevent that from happening.
5938648,eng,Tom is an important person.
10075742,eng,There is much in common between the two countries culturally.
1956101,eng,I only wish there was some way I could repay you.
7202047,eng,Sami used the office bathroom.
8825717,eng,"She tossed off her little V. A. D. cap, and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair, and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea."
1029405,eng,Tom couldn't hide his feelings from Mary.
20002,eng,The chairman suggested that we should discuss the problem.
2422955,eng,What are you expecting from the new year?
6265847,eng,Tom would never contradict me.
8572653,eng,He takes the train unaccompanied.
6515087,eng,I know how busy Tom and Mary have been.
7981989,eng,Sami hid in the women's bathroom.
279796,eng,Tokyo is as large a city as any in Japan.
7737435,eng,Why does Tom want us to do that?
257177,eng,I am far from blaming you.
6730997,eng,He purchased land with a good view for building his house.
6708012,eng,Sami wanted more coffee.
9085354,eng,This is a very famous canvas.
8469867,eng,I received an email from Tom about thirty minutes ago.
10498524,eng,She arrived very late.
2648634,eng,We need supplies.
6648215,eng,Tom said that he thought that Mary wouldn't do that today.
289172,eng,He always wears blue shirts.
2703806,eng,May you win!
7749800,eng,"I'm full, thank you very much!"
6474886,eng,Sami and Layla's marriage flourished.
5125036,eng,You still haven't learned yet.
6824090,eng,Tom has been there all day.
302466,eng,He erred in his judgement.
6973380,eng,Tom is a hearty eater.
9770856,eng,Yanni is a gym regular.
3330352,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom's lying.
6948444,eng,Do you have any plans for the summer?
8480393,eng,He's super busy.
6324373,eng,It's not so easy as I thought it was.
6343582,eng,I didn't know Tom did that yesterday.
6929305,eng,Talk about huge egos.
3204887,eng,"If I tell you what I need, can you buy it for me?"
7408329,eng,They go everywhere by themselves.
7445202,eng,Tom and Mary told everyone they were scared.
10095823,eng,There seem to be quite a few people here.
3903689,eng,I had lunch with her.
7294674,eng,Sami and Layla never discussed this.
1024637,eng,Tom kicked the ball.
1423570,eng,Maybe we can talk.
9049913,eng,"I can't even fold one more crane, she said to herself."
1460480,eng,He has a brother in Tokyo.
8593730,eng,Have you really lost your wallet again?
3819720,eng,It's not a good time.
1908468,eng,Stop hitting me!
10762970,eng,I've been waiting for this chance.
6580889,eng,I'm really not sure this will work.
8370370,eng,This isn't what I needed.
7999788,eng,Mennad used to work a night shift from nine to midnight.
2281875,eng,Why don't they like me?
7164835,eng,Sami was a little irritated.
3157596,eng,Do you watch the TV in the morning?
5218530,eng,Spanish is very similar to Portuguese.
7476475,eng,They repainted their house.
6100203,eng,Layla isn't with Sami.
1780600,eng,I think that German syntax is difficult.
918751,eng,The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.
316166,eng,She is attractive when she is dressed in white.
1129963,eng,He is working in AIDS research.
2979867,eng,Gods came down to earth to guide humanity to its end.
6272604,eng,I want to be a singer.
7384519,eng,He did exactly as I told him to do.
6523563,eng,Tom will likely walk to work tomorrow morning.
6358546,eng,Tom handed Mary his keys.
1282992,eng,I'm getting homesick.
521603,eng,This desk is too heavy to lift.
4918924,eng,I'm going to try it.
10456434,eng,She definitely has a crush on Tom.
2273099,eng,Tom is divorcing Mary.
6125156,eng,Tom is the one who mows the lawn.
8392398,eng,I want Tom to show me how to do that.
4459803,eng,Since when are you wearing contacts?
8131697,eng,Tom was supposed to help me on Monday.
9145539,eng,Slow ahead!
6500956,eng,I think Tom and Mary are the only ones who want to do that.
6308069,eng,Sami was finally ready for divorce.
2111376,eng,They cheered.
1979257,eng,How beautiful you are today!
276782,eng,I don't like warm winters.
7504615,eng,I know you probably didn't do what you were supposed to.
9056522,eng,"There's no need to understand women, but rather accept and love them."
7505570,eng,I know that Tom knows why Mary didn't want to do that.
2544465,eng,"You're not upset, are you?"
9011927,eng,What can she tell her?
303428,eng,He must have gotten over his cold.
1549748,eng,Mary got mad at me.
6021890,eng,Howdy!
7171445,eng,I thought that you said you've only tried doing that once.
3189137,eng,Tom sings very well.
9076080,eng,Algiers is home to many Algerian universities.
3201242,eng,You've never told me about that.
7512239,eng,I know that you're not doing that right now.
10084950,eng,Tom has a good sense of hearing.
10773569,eng,"She had stationed herself by the tube entrance and was leaning against the tiled wall, listening to the music coming from a pub across the road, when her friends came walking into view."
8382781,eng,My achievements speak for themselves.
6419635,eng,"Mary could've complained, but she didn't."
463320,eng,This is my sister. She is called Julia.
10030465,eng,Do you see that? Yanni likes you.
7248653,eng,Sami does YouTube just for the money.
5613534,eng,Mary tapped her foot on the floor.
7227263,eng,What're the chances that Tom will want to do that with us?
7337707,eng,When did people start to use tools?
51204,eng,Such ability is native to him.
6418843,eng,Mary could've done that faster by herself.
1138136,eng,I thought it was absurd that you got punished.
23594,eng,I got a lot of mosquito bites.
2990575,eng,We can't hire anyone new right now.
10359749,eng,Everything's still new to me.
6981763,eng,"I remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveller, and gold-digger, and how had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?"
8271543,eng,He called the imam.
7123512,eng,I don't know where Tom died.
9049893,eng,"I'm sorry, but your name isn't on the list."
9146054,eng,Yanni was sent overseas for a work trip in Algeria for four months.
2427913,eng,My brother lied to me.
6810606,eng,Sami can quit.
10697071,eng,She's fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.
2111378,eng,They canceled.
2747386,eng,I didn't know what else to say.
9463185,eng,Tom put on somebody else's coat.
5735739,eng,Tom has no political ambition.
8960429,eng,Firefighters are some of the most courageous people in the world.
7214499,eng,Tom told me that he thought you were cute.
4529633,eng,It was Tom who washed your car.
7132362,eng,It only takes me three minutes to do that.
640823,eng,She has a real knack for getting people to do what she wants.
3446958,eng,You'd better order replacements.
7439452,eng,They said they're afraid to do that.
6233582,eng,Tom's skull was crushed when the building collapsed.
954664,eng,Why do some people burp after they eat?
2639704,eng,Tom asked Mary some questions that she was unable to answer.
6812121,eng,I think that Tom is a good boy.
9814634,eng,There's no denying that Tom is a handsome guy.
3930928,eng,Dan was reassigned to work at the sales department.
299912,eng,He got accustomed to the new way of living.
6407032,eng,Mary wondered whether she should really give Tom what she'd bought him.
265037,eng,Don't hesitate to ask questions.
3394418,eng,That's not good enough for Tom.
7213000,eng,Tom is going to be waiting for Mary.
8359686,eng,Has anyone in your family been to Boston?
3738342,eng,Who's the guy Tom is talking to?
2144568,eng,She was the first one to notice him.
42856,eng,It was a delightful bit of nonsense.
8838509,eng,I usually lock my car.
5745159,eng,Tom said he could take it.
6497404,eng,Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice wasn't tired.
2647013,eng,Tom crawled into bed.
6428269,eng,"Mary is outgoing, isn't she?"
1961308,eng,I thought I was losing my mind.
6698573,eng,Everybody in the class laughed at Tom.
33150,eng,It's been raining for around a week.
8395813,eng,Tom wasn't the first one who did that.
6896623,eng,I'm worried that I'll get lost.
6062271,eng,Why did you buy one of those?
284729,eng,"As is often the case with him, he sits up late at night."
9150172,eng,I rescued a kitten.
7230996,eng,I don't think that I'd like to live in Boston.
681499,eng,You can mix different foods in a blender.
1029392,eng,Tom couldn't think of any reason for not giving Mary the present.
9099294,eng,My strength to continue to fight ran out.
50981,eng,There you see the gate which Mr Jones built.
10244068,eng,Jews are also known as Hebrews and Israelites.
3121678,eng,Tom looked a little flustered.
10206728,eng,Ziri was standing in that spot.
6312680,eng,Sami could do nothing except lie in bed.
8185838,eng,I didn't realize that you and Tom were so close.
7173850,eng,I thought Tom was still studying French.
7137973,eng,Sami likes Layla's skirt.
8341458,eng,Lunch should be ready soon.
7383672,eng,She almost killed herself.
6790050,eng,Have you seen the new car that Tom bought?
10109916,eng,This sector is so important in Algeria.
7199033,eng,Sami's dog had no tail.
8254464,eng,He knows Islam is the truth.
6482560,eng,I think Tom's hiding something from me.
1295025,eng,I didn't speak for long.
8758618,eng,What is freedom of panorama?
6225689,eng,Tom is going to be very angry if Mary does that.
5937395,eng,I wonder what has happened to Tom.
10231709,eng,Ziri drove a Porsche similar to that one.
7371423,eng,The boys attempted to kill frogs with sharpened sticks.
387069,eng,He stopped reading newspapers.
6870890,eng,Tom would have done the same thing you did.
6415660,eng,Mary has asked Tom to show her how to do that.
5809800,eng,His brother can't sing.
6651118,eng,Tom said that he wouldn't buy any of Mary's paintings.
276627,eng,Nobody listened to me.
8893823,eng,"We view compliance with existing standards as important, but this does not override our own requirements."
5353352,eng,We'll miss living in Boston.
10598910,eng,You'll get over it soon enough.
9117222,eng,"Yanni is in his own homeland, Algeria."

7856721,eng,Algeria wants to attract more foreign investments.
453598,eng,The following people were put to the test.
6232416,eng,"Tom could've been frightened, but he didn't seem to be."
259585,eng,"I met with a cool, not to say hostile, reception."
10492769,eng,Are you just pretending to be sick?
3826297,eng,Tom was married before.
8566014,eng,What happened in Venezuela won't happen in Algeria.
8234229,eng,I'm not used to living in poverty.
6267548,eng,I've been here since 2003.
6222365,eng,Tom told the children a story.
7440653,eng,They said they're unemployed.
6240857,eng,I want to know how much money Tom spent.
3396497,eng,Tom had never seen the man before in his life.
2064554,eng,What he needs is practice.
8596986,eng,At least Tom knows where he stands.
2895971,eng,"There are theatres, museums, libraries and parks in that city."
8244779,eng,Tunisia and Algeria gained independence from France in 1956 and 1962 respectively.
6497813,eng,I would've hugged Tom and Mary if I'd thought they'd let me.
251970,eng,My name doesn't appear on the list.
10703005,eng,I'm fed up with surprises.
8506302,eng,You can slice the cake now that we're hungry.
1522127,eng,She was looking at me.
10583269,eng,"It isn't forbidden, but it's not allowed, either."
62089,eng,How long does it take from here to your house on foot?
285200,eng,"Judging from what he says, he seems to be a man of ability."
4728331,eng,Excuse me. Where's the metro?
10181411,eng,I must stay in this room all night.
7981977,eng,Sami wanted to withdraw money.
7399855,eng,He said he's been here before.
3722235,eng,I suggest you hide.
3734812,eng,Tom just wanted Mary to help him a little more with the children.
7813232,eng,We weren't ready for it.
619974,eng,How is it you use the numbers of Arabic?
6043693,eng,Layla bought a gun.
7757712,eng,I read Berber books for pleasure.
1963118,eng,I wonder who named this ship.
6266184,eng,I think that I can do that.
4124521,eng,I want you to be my girlfriend.
291497,eng,He gave it to me for nothing.
1115369,eng,What time does that restaurant close?
8232819,eng,We went for a swim in the river.
6818616,eng,Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.
5192517,eng,Two of the soldiers were killed and the rest were captured.
10303724,eng,That's not my boat.
2155146,eng,Stop laughing!
10212966,eng,Ziri turned off the stereo.
696403,eng,Would you like to travel to the United States?
2483518,eng,I baked these cookies for you.
6717692,eng,Sami drove for hours.
2770651,eng,Maybe Pinocchio's wooden head with its built-in high-tech microchip has more intelligence than the rest of the world.
5186107,eng,I just needed a change.
2396289,eng,May I borrow your car tonight?
3906047,eng,Have you talked to them lately?
9189229,eng,She is drinking water.
8234049,eng,She doesn't have anything to fear.
19181,eng,Strong winds stripped the tree of its leaves.

3910800,eng,I'll replace him.
10719110,eng,"Give a man enough rope, and he'll hang himself."
6815112,eng,Everybody is ready to go.
6408309,eng,Was it you who told Mary she wouldn't be allowed to do that?
932513,eng,Last night I had a weird dream.
10600871,eng,There were several nights when I cried.
10165441,eng,Nobody here recalls Tom.
2301960,eng,I can't explain it right now.
8999711,eng,My dog​ is the one over there.
1479114,eng,Tom started screaming like a 15-year old girl.
2218440,eng,"You're thirty, right?"
3317858,eng,The birch has white bark.
6119281,eng,Sami and Layla had a nice dinner together.
1190297,eng,"Because it rained, I didn't go."
437015,eng,I want a book. Where is the bookstore?
9204489,eng,No one listened to Tom.

5877757,eng,Fadil bought a new house in the country.

2362085,eng,I don't know how much longer I can do this.
6241537,eng,That's the best idea I've heard all week.
41016,eng,A crowd of people were present at a party.
7542530,eng,Tom died on October 20th in Australia.
8843865,eng,Tom didn't want to take part in the ceremony.
7137464,eng,The acting in this series is pathetic.
6269202,eng,Tom was glad Mary helped him do that.
10230559,eng,Only Ziri would eat this shit.
1287473,eng,Maybe I know this person!
1029183,eng,Tom doesn't have to hide his feelings from Mary.
6900185,eng,Tom finally got the courage to propose to his girlfriend.
7502522,eng,I knew Tom was the kind of guy who would do that kind of thing.
6663169,eng,I'm going to buy a new saxophone.
2245610,eng,I apologize again.
2244933,eng,Are you bachelors?
8008347,eng,Mennad is just being superstitious.
3961235,eng,"When half of the Moon's disc is illuminated, we call it the first quarter moon. This name comes from the fact that the Moon is now one-quarter of the way through the lunar month."
45294,eng,The man shot three birds with a gun.
6260088,eng,We shouldn't be in Boston now.
5737447,eng,Tom doesn't have any of that.
3823664,eng,Tom probably thought I was hungry.
8962786,eng,They ruined their clothes.
3358946,eng,You know too much about me.
4247945,eng,I am going to learn a lot from you.
312826,eng,She called me many a time.
6082784,eng,The bank manager trusts all employees.
9033108,eng,I still have other things that I need to do.
9146406,eng,Tom didn't say what you think he said.
3392975,eng,Where do I go now?
10225274,eng,Ziri made Rima spaghetti and meatballs.
3821260,eng,You seem to dislike reading.
7235422,eng,Tom doesn't play video games as often as he used to.
2253843,eng,Use your feet.
2643449,eng,Why did you have to do that?
6810301,eng,Sami opened Layla's message.
6898767,eng,I'll close the door for you.
8057711,eng,Mennad is going to make a video.
6500876,eng,Tom and Mary are moving to Boston at the end of this month.
316276,eng,She is nothing to him.
2951223,eng,Would you like to have some meatballs?
4666982,eng,Tom is exactly right.
5471345,eng,"Tom is one of Tatoeba's sacred ""icons"". Therefore, he is untouchable."

10023283,eng,Yanni believed in Skura.
3172167,eng,I can tell you don't like it here.
3903823,eng,You need to go with us now.
3913508,eng,Let's let her do it.
3916229,eng,We have to get her out of here.
6751072,eng,The plane dropped the bomb over the city.
9365505,eng,Have you ever seen a monkey playing a piano?
6715499,eng,Sami didn't show up this morning.
6675774,eng,Many mangrove forests can be recognized by their dense tangle of prop roots that make the trees appear to be standing on stilts above the water.
2276071,eng,I don't know how long.
8336208,eng,I can already do that well.
6344595,eng,Please make Tom eat his vegetables.
5040698,eng,Do they still make cassette tapes?
7381374,eng,"Mary is still up, isn't she?"
9955261,eng,I bought a new suitcase the day before yesterday.
7902039,eng,Why did you put it there?
3923046,eng,Tom sleeps on his back.
5838722,eng,Fadil checked into a motel.
1728242,eng,Have you ever wrung sweat out of your clothes?
10558176,eng,"Fascinating, isn't it?"
3995643,eng,Today's my grandson's birthday.
9067957,eng,This is all that I have left.
7404685,eng,She said she's optimistic.
6655497,eng,"At that time, I was too young and to understand what was happening."
280654,eng,"All of a sudden, the barn went up in flames."
2047123,eng,I haven't decided.
2640763,eng,Tom and Mary walked out of the classroom.
7544748,eng,We had a lot of chances to do that while we were in Australia.
8517395,eng,I had no idea that you felt that way.
1309444,eng,He was imprisoned.
10121931,eng,Japanese pears look just like apples.
9804302,eng,Yanni has just entered the house.
5226970,eng,He returns from New York tomorrow.
10092222,eng,Algeria needs to control the region to survive.
6808269,eng,How should he look like?
9481096,eng,I'll accept my fate.
58468,eng,It is difficult to understand this novel.
9377052,eng,She's not waiting for me.
1977846,eng,Aren't you a little young?
8555422,eng,My shoes are missing.
7152806,eng,Tom talked about growing up in Australia.
2392943,eng,Tom seemed unsuccessful.
293571,eng,He played an important role on the committee.
8407164,eng,My French is not so bad.
8547051,eng,How many giraffes live in the wild?
2252644,eng,There's another option.
8958801,eng,Why can't you come with us?
6905971,eng,Who are you meeting at 3:00PM?
6273793,eng,Tom said he felt good.
4666331,eng,Tom wants to change that.
8282272,eng,I don't have a lot of support.
8860376,eng,The beans are then ground into a mash.
3725038,eng,That was very thoughtful of Tom.
7500932,eng,I think that Tom used to be one of the janitors at the school where Mary teaches.
495660,eng,Do you have some good medicine?
7375845,eng,"Mary is a reckless driver, isn't she?"
8964897,eng,Oil leaked into the Gulf for 87 days.
3307247,eng,I thought that we had agreed not to talk about that anymore.
40813,eng,Because we'll all fall down on the cold ground.
2763400,eng,Tom must be mad to take such a chance.
3579565,eng,He was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
10549993,eng,He was in England when the war broke out.
2654577,eng,People are getting down.

4014032,eng,Who should I be afraid of?
6810404,eng,Sami knew who his stalker was.
7404276,eng,She said she felt left out.
7204936,eng,I didn't hear anyone screaming.
8518897,eng,Nobody called the police.
328134,eng,"When I use contacts, my eyes feel dry and become red."
7431936,eng,You will go and not return but die in battle.
415633,eng,"I think hairiness is a symbol of masculinity, so I really like it."
10674214,eng,"If you like astronomy, maybe read the article ""On the Galaxy Motions in Laniakea Supercluster."""
10365271,eng,They only do what they're told.
6717742,eng,Sami hanged out with his fellow fire fighters.
7383246,eng,He had the right to defend himself.
6344438,eng,"Tom wouldn't really buy that, would he?"
4665148,eng,We're aware of the challenges.
6416126,eng,Mary says she doesn't know how Tom does that.
5990320,eng,Tom always carries his camera with him.
8572517,eng,He takes his city's subway system to and from school.
6262404,eng,I'm still willing to do that.
6558277,eng,Phobos has an oblong shape with an average diameter of about 14 miles (22 kilometers).
6727876,eng,Jim joined ISIS.
9524871,eng,He's in the emergency room.
8479333,eng,He loved sports.
9944804,eng,Tom didn't tell us what he put in the stew.
10201617,eng,"What's Tom been up to that's got you so hot and bothered? ""Best ask him yourself."""
8478035,eng,He seemed wise.
7237353,eng,Sami went to college to get a degree.
246203,eng,Not all the candidates can pass the examination.
6912435,eng,Have you ever been engaged to be married?
5789982,eng,Tom was afraid of germs and washed his hands every time he touched the hotel's remote.
10158324,eng,Yanni no longer spends time with Rima.
7110933,eng,I think that this is totally outrageous.
6335128,eng,Tom said Mary was planning on going on her own.
7507407,eng,I know Tom isn't a very good heavy metal guitarist.
8754284,eng,I got permission to translate her sentences.
6275522,eng,That was supposed to be a secret.
6072117,eng,Layla wanted some time alone.
3912785,eng,I've always liked him.
6245785,eng,"You did that very quickly, didn't you?"
7398085,eng,She was asleep when she was shot.
63416,eng,Cambodia appealed to the United Nations for help.
8389075,eng,You need to pay three more dollars.
8272209,eng,"Are you free later? ""No, not today. When are you free?"""
10056554,eng,"I send you out to get garlic, and you come back with chocolate?"
1029246,eng,Tom didn't want Mary to go out with other guys.
8515322,eng,She said she wanted to kill him.
6225770,eng,What are you planning to make for dinner?
5967723,eng,"Nobody is born good, they have to learn how to be virtuous."
8007890,eng,Mennad divorced Baya after that.
4526784,eng,I can't stand violence.
2575774,eng,"If so believed, it is God; if not, it is a stone."
9690382,eng,I'm up to my neck in debt.
7214329,eng,Tom told me that he liked the movie.
6511379,eng,Tom and Mary weren't looking for sympathy.
3439707,eng,Tom makes lots of promises he doesn't keep.
6261823,eng,Tom enlisted in the Army in 2013.
8160961,eng,"When the bullfighter left, the previous racket was silenced."
7981970,eng,Sami thought Layla would have sex with him.
7504985,eng,Tom isn't the one who told me I didn't need to do that.
3172396,eng,Are you domineering?
8430956,eng,Tom went to school early.
7246038,eng,Sami was going up the steps.
7142927,eng,I didn't think your approach would work.
3902936,eng,What would we do without her?
8251571,eng,This doctor doesn't know anything about his patients.
5119723,eng,He's very fastidious when it comes to booking trips.
1606075,eng,The temperature today is seventy degrees Fahrenheit.
10223983,eng,Ziri used to be a bubbly soul.
7522193,eng,Everyone knew Tom didn't want to be here.
10461634,eng,I only recognized three names on the list.
8196780,eng,Which is the name of his family?
6267749,eng,I want to pay off my loan.
2546467,eng,That wasn't the reason.
7401519,eng,He admitted that he was lazy.
1228255,eng,"A bodyguard is a person whose job it is to guard the body, and therefore the life, of another person."
10454485,eng,"Remember, man, that you are dust, and you shall return to dust."

4565625,eng,What kind of plans do you have for the weekend?
6223583,eng,Nobody else at the party spoke French.
3905406,eng,I told her what time to come.
6659575,eng,I'll be arriving in Boston this evening.
1566329,eng,This is speaking.
10506026,eng,They've proved it multiple times.
9488024,eng,It's absolutely necessary for Tom to do that today.
5726744,eng,Tom was well-known in the community.
10765578,eng,Ziri was slightly moving.
6656097,eng,I don't like having to admit that I can't do something.
3148383,eng,I'm not going to take you back to Boston with me.
3241825,eng,I thought everyone knew that.
8799696,eng,Was the Pope’s tomb ever opened?
2747530,eng,Don't touch my daughter!
2984062,eng,"Scott, Dario and Ryan were very sporty."
6527560,eng,"Tom is never going to see Mary again, is he?"
8515606,eng,He knows he can always count on her.
7449930,eng,Why does she always have to be so mean?
66494,eng,Your courage will come out in a crisis.
1955135,eng,We can't win.
7493106,eng,Tom said jokingly that he wasn't very rich.
6344578,eng,Can you tell me why you didn't do that?
6242171,eng,I expect I'll have to buy that for Tom.
3157865,eng,"Can I get you a drink, Tom?"
8030119,eng,Where would you like me to put this box?
7409261,eng,They opened their eyes.
9075633,eng,They shot aerial footage of Algiers.
8623246,eng,The novel coronavirus outbreak has hit the United States on the tail end of spring break — a time-honored March tradition for college students.
293535,eng,He seems to have been rich before.
2643885,eng,Tom was listening intently.
276457,eng,You may invite to the festival whoever wants to come.
2014338,eng,I wanted to say that I'm sorry.
7502684,eng,I know that Tom knows that he isn't supposed to be doing that.
9733204,eng,My daughter had a huge fit when we told her we weren't going to take her to the park.
3173336,eng,This is the young lady you asked to see.
10531034,eng,Thanks for the detailed explanation.
6650353,eng,Tom said that he didn't know that Mary was going to eventually do that.
55996,eng,Is this a picture of your own painting?
9431668,eng,"After several hospitalizations over the last few months, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing died on Wednesday at the age of 94 in his chateau."
3273558,eng,He has sore eyes.
8439852,eng,How many feet are there in a yard?
7409693,eng,They ate their salad.
6646093,eng,Tom's speech wasn't as boring as Mary's.
3734752,eng,Tom told me what he thought of my plan.
10471405,eng,They required that Tom be punished.
7541633,eng,Tom was the only one who wasn't drinking.
3729245,eng,Not everything is about you.
8965007,eng,Whose room is it?
1936110,eng,"Almost every day, people lose their lives on highway A2."
10774272,eng,"I went there by bus, but I walked home."
7144193,eng,I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
1805362,eng,He thinks that I don't know what he said about me.
10144838,eng,I haven't slept since this morning.
6255625,eng,Tom said that he wanted some money.
8411629,eng,He became an undercover Muslim.
2549589,eng,We have to win.
3360162,eng,"You hate this kind of stuff, don't you?"
2031328,eng,I suppose you want to ask Tom some questions.
323541,eng,I think it is cruel to trap animals for fur coats.
681078,eng,I broke a glass when I did the dishes.
9686096,eng,Ask Tom to come here immediately.
1028626,eng,Tom ignored Mary.
7174217,eng,I thought that I told you to never come here again.
5843712,eng,I didn't see Tom doing that.
6899012,eng,"Tom is mad at me, isn't he?"
4529184,eng,Maybe Tom couldn't afford to buy a ticket.
6420405,eng,Mary didn't think she needed a new coat.
6104340,eng,Aren't you a friend of Tom's?
3722426,eng,You were a mistake.
8160950,eng,The carnaval finished with the traditional burial of the sardine and the city returned to the normal peace and quiet.
7515932,eng,I know Tom won't have to do that alone.
1247961,eng,I'll put my eyes out so I won't see you again.
2771427,eng,Did the doctor give you any medicine for your cold?

8828112,eng,You're the best!
6872870,eng,I'm sorry I forgot to tell you about the party.
1931162,eng,She reminds me of someone.
9649623,eng,You need to ask for help when you need it.
6431023,eng,I don't know whether Tom still lives in Boston or not.

257153,eng,I went to the station to see my brother off.

3906307,eng,I want you to talk to us.

6408913,eng,Mary said she'd stay and help us clean up after the party.
3185249,eng,"You're staying with Tom, right?"
6264049,eng,Tom apparently needs to do that.
9447065,eng,The children received presents.
7509572,eng,I didn't know Tom would be fired for doing that.
7483029,eng,"When I looked up at him I found his keen, grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression."
8995432,eng,I like cold water.
1023963,eng,Tom was late for work again this morning.
7380269,eng,"Mary is working now, isn't she?"
3439417,eng,Tom is much better at French than Mary is.
1168496,eng,Tom felt a tad awkward around Mary.
5825062,eng,I'm glad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day.
8589546,eng,You looked like someone who didn't want to be disturbed.
5916891,eng,Have you heard from Tom again?
4017173,eng,How old are you anyway?
2896769,eng,The man loves the house.
6261515,eng,Giving up is always an option.
6348485,eng,Tom was the only one who got hurt.
297363,eng,He smiled at us and got on the train.

27140,eng,Can you help me when I move?
318879,eng,I feel uneasy in my father's presence.
6491912,eng,I hope Tom and Mary aren't quicker at doing that than I am.
6730949,eng,I did that in Boston.
3100406,eng,I would like to write a book.
2057794,eng,I'll blame it all on Tom.

3060860,eng,Tom is sure to be back by 2:30.
3912355,eng,I'll meet you at the library.
8999634,eng,Please take care of this mess.
245786,eng,The children were swimming in the altogether.
6340787,eng,It wasn't me who told you you ought to do that.
8828493,eng,Does Tom like cycling?
6301686,eng,"His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments."

7446749,eng,Mary's mouth went dry at the sight of Tom.
7110822,eng,I think that Tom is freaked.
2662784,eng,I think I can solve this problem without help.
6504454,eng,Tom and Mary aren't as cooperative as they used to be.
6358412,eng,We all had fun.
2948358,eng,I didn't want to interrupt the discussion.
1277743,eng,"Indeed she is not beautiful, but she is good-natured."
5955730,eng,She didn't say anything about that in her letter.
6666453,eng,I told Tom he should take the job.
2042662,eng,It's time for Tom to understand how we want things done.
8910269,eng,Are you going to leave your jacket in the cloakroom?
8544644,eng,He would like to become a simultaneous interpreter.
8763629,eng,"Hello, my little kitty friend!"
8893021,eng,He's got out on the wrong side of bed.
27161,eng,Lightning precedes thunder.
6262073,eng,There's a tollbooth up ahead.
6660716,eng,Tom always seems busy.

6241153,eng,You're not the only one who has a camera.
6654480,eng,Tom said he didn't think that Mary would be amused by what was happening.
3439892,eng,We're going to the beach. Wanna come?
7267927,eng,Sami asked for permission.

42736,eng,It was all our fault.
9152890,eng,"In the house, the ax comes from above."

8836743,eng,What did he write on the board?
6717983,eng,Sami felt very sad and disappointed at Layla.
10585394,eng,"Jai and I had a discussion about religion. He noted that I was being a Buddhist in a principally Christian family. He thinks that my funeral would be Christian, despite me being Buddhist. I said that it did not really matter what others thought. I knew that Jai liked Zen Buddhism, but was affected by his German wife Erika's Lutheran background. Jai's family in India was Hindu. I read that one of the ways a Buddhist monk could attain more enlightenment was if he lived in a cemetery. For me, having moved from Vancouver to Lulu Island was like moving to a cemetery. In fact, I am an Animist-Buddhist."
6425810,eng,Mary told me she'd call me back.

52500,eng,Stop playing cat and mouse with me and tell me the news.
6245279,eng,I don't need to tell Tom what to do.
312217,eng,She has not come here yet.
2550177,eng,That doesn't sound like something you would say.

2892252,eng,"This is so weird, isn't it?"
6646169,eng,Tom was afraid everyone would laugh at him.

4664015,eng,That would be terribly disappointing.

8803208,eng,Yanni noticed the dead-end sign but he continued to drive.
8646708,eng,"Tom wanted to give you a surprise party, but I knew you'd hate it, so I talked him out of it."
6973250,eng,The film was entertaining.
7856720,eng,"Algeria needs to start a ""return campaign"" in order to persuade its immigrants to return home."
6241337,eng,I didn't want to help Tom do that today.
1028757,eng,Tom has been avoiding Mary all day.
5737375,eng,Tom had many stories to tell.
3831747,eng,Is Tom going to be there?
2981555,eng,Read and translate.
6343911,eng,Tom would probably be afraid to do that.
7399440,eng,She told me she was heartbroken.
3668536,eng,"There's cake. Would you like some? ""Yeah!"""
28297,eng,Great men are not always wise.
677788,eng,I play with the PlayStation 3.
1415694,eng,Many games use dice as a random number generator.
3430996,eng,Tom is quite affectionate.
8526150,eng,"He's old, isn't he?"
3168224,eng,I've got one of these.
7228182,eng,I don't think that we should shut the window.
2712580,eng,You're very fortunate to have such a good job.
6658520,eng,I got in my car and followed the ambulance.
7436747,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were doing that now.
1329615,eng,She is washing the car.
3431231,eng,Tom will be out for the rest of the day.
7517963,eng,I knew that Tom was a ballet dancer.
2046702,eng,I'm busy on Saturday.
3738554,eng,Are you going with us?
6335380,eng,"Tom had planned to stay yesterday, but Mary told him to leave."
1725567,eng,I cannot switch the lamp on. The baby is sleeping.
10624191,eng,Things went well for him.
10124453,eng,If I could do it then I would!
9105678,eng,It is worth mentioning that he is a close friend of the president.
3302729,eng,I think I might buy that house on Park Street that's for sale.
1440592,eng,She really looks pretty.
312411,eng,She goes under the name of Yotchan.
9013147,eng,"The umbilical cord develops by the fifth week of embryonic development, replacing the yolk sac as the embryo's nutrient source."
2892365,eng,Tom ripped up the note.
2662774,eng,There's a problem I have to talk to you about.
2644226,eng,What did you have in mind?
7113698,eng,I like doing that best.
2389891,eng,I promise not to tell Tom.
43984,eng,That hat cost around fifty dollars.
7221730,eng,I'm pretty sure Tom will be at the meeting.
7984778,eng,Why does Tom want to live in Australia?
7213011,eng,I've got to get back home before Monday.
8174010,eng,Tom has a secret Instagram account.
6524536,eng,I think Tom will likely be home on Monday.
10778575,eng,"Tom's lying under the apple tree, asleep. ""Wake him up, then! Asleep! At this time of day? Have you ever heard the like!"""
9456338,eng,He's a Bulgarian Jew.
8367276,eng,Tom is completely right.
9211468,eng,"In the Northern Hemisphere, fall starts in September and ends in December."
903840,eng,I think it's time for me to get my eyes checked.
5194315,eng,"If you don't want to buy some unnecessary thing, don't go to the fair."
6666241,eng,Tom doesn't seem to be as forgetful as he used to be.
8366882,eng,Tom is half naked.
8544610,eng,His heart suddenly began to beat faster.
6424744,eng,Mary poured herself another glass.
3917865,eng,Is that good or bad for us?
7514603,eng,I know that Tom isn't a very good skater.
17110,eng,Where are your things?
7735261,eng,"Tom is pretty scary, don't you think?"
5292165,eng,Mary is smart and curious.
6265709,eng,Tom and I smiled at each other.
10232885,eng,Ziri wasn't expecting that many people.
9147167,eng,Tom bought some camera equipment.
2952815,eng,I'm not sure if this is really true or not.
3825141,eng,What were you really doing?
263128,eng,We have supplied the villagers with food.
303601,eng,He took a job with an insurance company.
6493985,eng,"Tom and Mary invited me to go with them, but I said I didn't want to."
7410368,eng,They said they were wounded.
534727,eng,Forget about her.
7025737,eng,"Come along, Watson. This is the house."
6232181,eng,Please give me a little more time to consider that.
7371731,eng,Tahiti is an island paradise.
7266180,eng,Sami wasn't financially in a good situation.
5938079,eng,I would never try to do that.
7197639,eng,It isn't my problem anymore.
7197195,eng,It isn't worth talking about.
7436399,eng,Tom and Mary said that they couldn't do that again.
323761,eng,I'm awake.
4298817,eng,He's force-feeding his goose.
2136671,eng,The boy is playing with his tin soldiers.
2647062,eng,They were all scared.
10235538,eng,Iranians are civilized.
7376401,eng,Mary poured more coffee for herself.
8988972,eng,Tom avoids eating fast food. He says that it is unhealthy.
2539435,eng,I'm still too weak to get out of bed.
10131980,eng,Who influences policies in Algeria?
306186,eng,They know how to swim.
10352856,eng,There's a drugstore on Park Street.
4499640,eng,I've already read this report.
3449377,eng,Tom has been here for three years.
6432744,eng,Mary said she thought Tom would need to do that.
9583412,eng,"I don't know what to say, so I'll give a speech."
7168532,eng,I think that Tom is devious.
2727416,eng,He organized his CDs by artist.
5852526,eng,I made an omelet for breakfast.
2011652,eng,I don't want visitors.
3387699,eng,You were right and I was wrong.
6271514,eng,Tom changed jobs recently.
2653178,eng,She's sloppy and careless.
5106377,eng,Tom has already started classes.
3129499,eng,What happens when you die?
10152194,eng,We're at our wit's end.
8946735,eng,He's taking part in an international contest.
8051797,eng,Tom was with a bunch of strangers.
3498632,eng,I did not see much of her as there were too many people in front of me blocking the view.
1886087,eng,Do you know Tom?
3360265,eng,You need to do what's right.
886894,eng,She advised him to go home early.
7393327,eng,He may do that anywhere he chooses.
3493397,eng,"Even if it is as fleeting as a scent or as quick as a thought, there is always a way to get what you desire."
7229391,eng,Sami never gravitated around wine.
2230211,eng,She baked a cake for her friend.
6209970,eng,I don't know. Why don't you ask her?
33064,eng,He really turns me off.
6268998,eng,Tom didn't like the way Mary did that.
8817654,eng,We don't seem to be a unit.
6508814,eng,Tom and Mary don't think that they should do that.
7230248,eng,I don't think that Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
7321008,eng,Sami gave me the gift.
10120420,eng,Algeria needs reforms to sustain its long-term economic growth.
3514302,eng,Do you think Tom knows about what we did?
1821353,eng,How many girlfriends does Tom have?
9453517,eng,We're pretty busy people.
9953938,eng,Yanni woke Skura up for sohor.
579224,eng,Children need a lot of sleep.
7237388,eng,Sami reeked of weed.
2239759,eng,Tom was contributing.
8340986,eng,Tom doesn't have any drinking water.
7278744,eng,Sami is making some popcorn.
3360206,eng,You'd better take care of it.
3419961,eng,Tom folded the blankets.
7037177,eng,He wanted to fight with the teacher.
2362004,eng,I've got to see you.
6517971,eng,Tom and Mary said that they were shocked.
1172509,eng,Blood and violence fascinate them.
9846477,eng,What are your dogs' names?
7791089,eng,They do not have what we require.
1463503,eng,They rented the room on the second floor to a student.
7867848,eng,"He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau."
286846,eng,His application went through.
7079652,eng,A little black dog is crossing the road.
1315789,eng,He's not the kind of person who always criticizes others.
6871092,eng,It's what Tom would have wanted.
10684571,eng,Some believe that there is much mental pollution in this world today.
4502777,eng,They voted against it.
6254370,eng,"You feel better today, don't you?"
7170038,eng,I think that Tom will wait.
8614446,eng,He never heard about it.
7780264,eng,I would like to book a trip to Australia.
7978869,eng,"Some chips, please."
9479131,eng,I bought sandals that match the ones Tom is wearing.
9549005,eng,Tom is so bombastic.
7170434,eng,I knew that Tom wasn't likely to do that.
6509076,eng,Did Tom and Mary say where they went last weekend?
7395083,eng,She doesn't know I wish she'd leave.
5836150,eng,Where's Tom's truck?
7160522,eng,Sami was a victim.
425081,eng,"When I get sick of what men do, I have only to walk a few steps in another direction to see what spiders do. Or what the weather does. This sustains me very well indeed."
7149303,eng,Who are you planning on going to Australia with?
6520236,eng,Tom and Mary are almost home now.
6358177,eng,Does Tom think Mary did that?
62478,eng,Ken is happy.
687872,eng,"Yes, it's true. And you?"
2892212,eng,This is going to be fabulous.
10127675,eng,We sold our house last month.
2538145,eng,Tom wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for you.
7159637,eng,I'm going to be in Australia all month.
2635972,eng,Go away. I was here first.
5205843,eng,What have you promised to do?
10119841,eng,"How is Mary so good at Japanese? ""Isn't her boyfriend Japanese?"" ""Oh, of course. Love can overcome anything."""
3271763,eng,We weren't expecting that he would call to see us.
2193081,eng,It wasn't a permission.
9824052,eng,That wasn't as easy as I expected.
2950154,eng,Tom is a former world triathlon champion.
8984901,eng,They flew around the entire galaxy.
9439753,eng,I'm afraid that won't help Tom.
5105751,eng,Tom changed the plan.
10559476,eng,We spent our entire day at the beach.
66308,eng,When did you get to know the fact?
8170435,eng,Will they make a lot of money?
585987,eng,"I have never sung, and never will sing, in a karaoke bar."
10128047,eng,Nobody knows where Tom is buried.
1664253,eng,It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
8521519,eng,She might need to help him.
3238942,eng,It's not safe to jump out of a moving truck.
2315026,eng,I didn't think I'd get there in time.
3822942,eng,They were going to lose.
3560914,eng,"Sometimes, we don't know if we are in love."
10616296,eng,Tom laughed without thinking.
6354423,eng,I'd do that if I were you.
244044,eng,At first I tried to write everything down in my notebook.
7983297,eng,Sami is serving fake alcohol.
6691304,eng,Sami and Layla both dove for the gun.
7442737,eng,They don't think they could do that.
1552710,eng,Financiers make good business only when the state is making it badly.
3651057,eng,"Since 1990, methane emissions have decreased by 11%."
7391507,eng,She turned off her headlights.
323563,eng,All's fish that comes to the net.
5104965,eng,Tom usually loses at blackjack.
39192,eng,Television is a very important medium through which to provide information.
6552672,eng,We haven't been alone in years.
8738198,eng,I prefer Keats's poems to Shelley's.
1028703,eng,Tom hasn't been able to get in touch with Mary yet.
9972719,eng,We've recently lost several big clients.
2537785,eng,I'm supposed to meet someone later for a drink.
3619980,eng,This is a nice apartment.
6436212,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't in Boston.
49238,eng,The singer was standing by in the studio.
4493663,eng,We have enough already.
7402036,eng,He said he's doing that now.
7117195,eng,Tom will never leave Mary.
2420060,eng,It's necessary for all members to follow these rules.
8510587,eng,You can drink the juice that's on the table.
3908076,eng,Tell him I'm innocent.
4076765,eng,Tom told us about what he did in Boston.
6926959,eng,Your home has become strange to you.
4889855,eng,My favorite vegetable is the tomato.
9785460,eng,Here's a hot take. Social Darwinism is an excuse for people to not give a damn about anyone else.
10600664,eng,Have they gone mad?
6529888,eng,Tom wanted to come here tomorrow.
3121565,eng,He saw her video.
6268969,eng,Tom promised that he'd call.
1025896,eng,Tom doesn't work here anymore.
7180407,eng,Tom said that he was glad that you could do that.
9809678,eng,Let's hope that things stay this way.
10209872,eng,Ziri became an actuary.
3913805,eng,You'd better leave her alone.
41869,eng,Well do I remember it.
8052546,eng,Mennad taught his students to critically think.
6408572,eng,Mary was the first one who said she didn't want to do that.
6289906,eng,Just another moment!
10631962,eng,What did you wear yesterday?
6344036,eng,Where will you be three hours from now?
9755968,eng,Tom likes avocados.
6516320,eng,"Tom and Mary are very nervous, aren't they?"
3023460,eng,Tom left the next morning.
7189651,eng,Sami said absolutely nothing.
6226141,eng,When did you first hear that Tom had been arrested?
7476574,eng,They say they want to win.
6264090,eng,Tom has advised Mary not to do that anymore.
8520161,eng,She put a cup of coffee on the table in front of him.
8633905,eng,Istanbul has a population of more than 16 million people.
5898046,eng,The boy is learning to read and write.
1004403,eng,"He has gotten better, so he'll soon be able to leave the hospital."
2111759,eng,I'm armed.
906950,eng,What's your favorite ZZ Top song?
8683003,eng,My company has decided to outsource my job.
5206966,eng,I just knew I had to try.
8381107,eng,Tom is afraid that he'll hurt Mary's feelings.
10515888,eng,Can further price rises be prevented?
3822533,eng,"Tom, can you hear me?"
1348053,eng,Let's build the country with actions and words.
6793606,eng,Sami is not your everyday criminal.
10456288,eng,I'm speaking Estonian.
264451,eng,Don't take it for granted that nature is always there to help us.
6414928,eng,Mary didn't let her children go to Tom's party.
7443039,eng,They know they have to be patient.
64779,eng,Oranges have a high vitamin content.
9698566,eng,A smile spread across his face.
7857876,eng,I'm not a Canadian citizen.
6339694,eng,I didn't think you were going to do that by yourself.
1963214,eng,Is Tom still the captain of your ship?
6492121,eng,How do Tom and Mary plan to help?
2639974,eng,Tom sat on that park bench for nearly three hours.
2821260,eng,Tom doesn't often take vacations.
3725386,eng,You're my good luck charm.
3010174,eng,Tom doesn't have any chance of winning.
3939914,eng,She took a change of clothes in her suitcase as they were staying overnight.
5744193,eng,Tom is on trial for murder.
10677702,eng,No one likes to be lied to.
7541434,eng,Tom promised he'd help us on October 20th.
7110541,eng,I wonder whether Tom and I are really supposed to do that.
4630398,eng,Tom doesn't want to live in fear.
3330948,eng,You might see Tom there.
2099894,eng,Opaque? Not at all. Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer.
6326885,eng,One drop makes the glass overflow.
2546340,eng,Tom tried to be casual.
6069678,eng,Layla had to go.
7732263,eng,Tom encouraged Mary to stop smoking.
10672089,eng,A lot of people don't like spicy food.
7542975,eng,Tom asked me how many cousins I had.
8879734,eng,Do you drink water?
52672,eng,John spoke in such a loud voice that I could hear him upstairs.
1776577,eng,Why are you spitting?
9678239,eng,He's a little wild.
6115597,eng,Tom knew that Mary wasn't going to go to Boston with John.
10199861,eng,Tom has had a rough patch at work.
6870420,eng,We could have managed.
3150831,eng,Did you buy them?
6423151,eng,Mary said that she wasn't concerned.
9960162,eng,There are many ways to start a game of chess. One of the most used is to move white the pawn from e2 to e4: 1. e4.
10080070,eng,"In Algeria, wages remain low."
2544897,eng,I'd rather die than leave.
6340358,eng,I speak French better than most of my classmates.
8476528,eng,He'll share.
3185042,eng,Are you asking me to stay?
8374364,eng,"The platypus, a small amphibious Austrian mammal, is a very shy animal."
8376754,eng,"I'm going to faint. ""You're faking."""
2647731,eng,Are you on the list?
8351924,eng,Tom was chosen from three thousand applicants.
6490492,eng,Tom and Mary said they thought John might be permitted to do that when he gets older.
7199989,eng,Tom promised Mary he wouldn't look at other girls.
6421341,eng,"When Mary did that, Tom yelled at her."
245602,eng,My sister expects to graduate from college next year.
10041195,eng,Yanni swore.
6334604,eng,You should tell Tom that Mary is planning to go.
2956128,eng,Tom bent down and picked up the pen that he'd dropped.
8344825,eng,Tom fixed that three weeks ago.
10365416,eng,You've been good soldiers.
7998352,eng,Mennad was a traitor.
4501623,eng,Tom raised his arm.
6529682,eng,Tom is used to having Mary around.
244303,eng,Writers draw on their imagination.
8595221,eng,She's gay.
2673977,eng,It was not my mistake.
3281722,eng,Tom said he didn't want to waste time arguing.
7542792,eng,Tom bought gifts for all his friends.
9141561,eng,We're writers.
301943,eng,He was detected in the very act of stealing.
8521856,eng,He leaned over to kiss her.
8096337,eng,Tom was not having an easy time.
3121833,eng,Tom looked at Mary again.
320271,eng,The wall is white within and green without.
6177797,eng,"More than gold, lead changed the world, and, more than the lead in shotguns, that in the types of typographic boxes."
43580,eng,It was decided that the ball game be put off.
684035,eng,It's phony.
8053981,eng,I want Tom to come here right away.
6426825,eng,Mary didn't make herself clear.
62448,eng,Ken is an eager student.
6513860,eng,Tom and Mary said they can't wait any longer.
2910672,eng,It's not long till the winter holidays.
9270103,eng,We are English.
6844945,eng,Tom has decided to stop smoking.
6821852,eng,Here's a photo of Tom.
6662663,eng,"Tom is upstairs in his room, crying."
1487358,eng,My grandfather likes reading books.
9611462,eng,None of this is mine.
4813020,eng,This pirate has a pet parrot.
7361299,eng,Tom is most likely at home.
6346405,eng,I don't think Tom drank anything.
10254090,eng,Tom misunderstood what I had said.
9448198,eng,I'll get to it as soon as possible.
3172267,eng,Do you know where the can opener is?
2248921,eng,It wasn't long.
6267696,eng,Tom thought Mary might want to do that.
6935704,eng,"Tom is in bed reading, isn't he?"
5921209,eng,Sami burned all of Layla's possessions.
1094748,eng,Tom didn't have to yell at me.
6530184,eng,Tom says he has to work tonight.
3312762,eng,We can deal with them.
37619,eng,How much will it cost?
6432510,eng,Tom didn't want the same thing to happen to Mary.
6448353,eng,Sami really doesn't care about anything else.
7217796,eng,You can't deny Tom is charming.
9731771,eng,Tom was arrested last night.
8204167,eng,Are these notebooks all yours?
6992030,eng,"Kailash Satyarthi, an Indian children's rights activist and Nobel peace prize laureate, led the 1998 Global March of enslaved and trafficked children. He said progress has been made since then, but much remains to be done."
602003,eng,That offer sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?

8549088,eng,The dead shall rise up again!
2064936,eng,I want to give Tom something special.
289147,eng,He always insisted that he was in the right.
3768010,eng,The small duckling is swimming.
7191555,eng,I should've told Tom not to stay in Australia.

6767413,eng,Come and sit here with me.
6437737,eng,Tom said that Mary wasn't alone.
5820545,eng,I think we arrived earlier than we expected.
6722159,eng,I definitely needed to do that.
6254072,eng,Do you own any property in Boston?
41690,eng,It's about time for him to get here.
3202405,eng,Tell Tom we plan to be there on time.
5936834,eng,I think learning French would be useful.
6898866,eng,"Tom is in love, isn't he?"
8591946,eng,We want to buy a new house.
9336171,eng,I'm tired of being treated this way.
46978,eng,We were all running short of money then.
5295038,eng,We need you to get here ASAP.
4016100,eng,That felt like an earthquake.
7539312,eng,Neither Tom nor Mary has been giving me any bad advice.
6018633,eng,"Explanations exist; they have existed for all time; there is always a well-known solution to every human problem - neat, plausible and wrong."

2239834,eng,Tom was prepared.
5916549,eng,You're clearly unhappy.
7078285,eng,It's not likely to be as difficult as you think it'll be.
6437709,eng,Tom said that he wasn't shocked.
8985339,eng,They had time to thumb through some comics before the store closed.
9776991,eng,How long will Tom stay?
5781625,eng,We both went to the concert.
7990190,eng,Sami got a friend request on Snapchat.
4494480,eng,That was the advantage.
10515705,eng,We were all fit to be tied.
6663064,eng,Tom is without a doubt a lot better French speaker than you are.
8520425,eng,He blamed the problem on her.
6652768,eng,Tom said he thought that he'd be able to help Mary weed the garden today.
7492989,eng,It seems to me that this isn't entirely wrong.
954315,eng,Thanks for stopping by.

2537816,eng,I thought you said nobody was going to be here.
1823823,eng,Mary has broad shoulders.
7202025,eng,Sami was gone for the entire day.
3903963,eng,What's that got to do with her?
8447397,eng,When did it start raining?
6657719,eng,This is the first time I've ever seen Tom wearing jeans.
328174,eng,"As the lesson comes to an end, even if the teacher doesn't say ""be quiet"" or ""sit down,"" the children naturally return to their seats and quieten down."
8436211,eng,"You're not ready to go, are you?"
38333,eng,He seems to have been ill for a long time.
5747218,eng,There is no substitute.

6523744,eng,It'll have to be done sooner or later.
8384100,eng,Tom seemed to be unwilling to do what we wanted him to do.
6410107,eng,Mary probably doesn't know that Tom has a crush on her.
4760356,eng,He has red flowers.
1933340,eng,He understands more or less his problems.
10564970,eng,"If it gets too intense, just let us know and we'll stop the experiment."
987483,eng,Please fix it.
1830514,eng,This is one of the best places to eat in town.
6869817,eng,Tom didn't have to shout. We could have heard him anyway.
9252741,eng,We were ready for anything.
6432036,eng,Tom is going to be back in less than thirty minutes.
6492300,eng,"Are you going to tell Tom and Mary that they can't come with us, or are you going to make me tell them?"
8340267,eng,Tom hasn't joined our club yet.
6253615,eng,Tom isn't the only one who's sleepy.
6256941,eng,Tom says he thinks Mary would really want to do that.
617678,eng,"The label on my scarf says, ""Wash and iron inside out."" I wonder how I'm supposed to do that."
6456836,eng,Sami was grumpy toward Layla.
8513201,eng,She needs to call a doctor.
7406404,eng,They said that they needed a change.
63333,eng,No doubt she will come soon.
8502745,eng,Mary has impressive credentials.
9265489,eng,I could never live in a place this hot.
6890270,eng,"I'm your best customer! said Tom. ""No, you're our worst,"" replied Mary."
9995405,eng,Yanni knows exactly where Skura is standing.
6655753,eng,"Tom isn't afraid, but Mary is."
10127636,eng,Tom found Mary a little strange.
7214748,eng,Tom told me that he didn't remember doing that.
7395566,eng,She says that she'll come tomorrow.
2280380,eng,Mary is a model.
6421218,eng,Mary denied that she'd stolen anything.
10071207,eng,She grew up.
18098,eng,Please remove your shoes before entering the house.
918927,eng,We will win the battle.

7170902,eng,I know that Tom will help Mary do that.
6508836,eng,Tom and Mary don't know they're going to be fired.
9075484,eng,Algeria has many flood-prone areas.
6035822,eng,That is an incomplete sentence.
6938716,eng,Up to thirty people will be allowed to do that.
6514675,eng,Tom and Mary are leaving here tomorrow.
2542110,eng,You've got to get out of here.
255562,eng,I had my suitcase carried to my room by a bellboy.
4595916,eng,Since when have you lived in Tokyo?

2240158,eng,"If you forget to take your pills for one day, take two pills the following day."
7183075,eng,I don't want to work in Australia.
7442160,eng,Tom and Mary were unable to hide their reactions.
7287379,eng,Sami had an issue with the cash register.
6337630,eng,I guess that's how I'd do that.
866329,eng,I took the trouble to write the answers to the comments.
7440922,eng,They said they like pizza.
1758821,eng,There's a Swedish embassy in Washington D.C.
388592,eng,She got me to believe that story.

1871897,eng,Something is moving behind the bush.
8396087,eng,Tom thinks everyone lies as much as he does.
6678631,eng,"If you'd been a little more patient, you would've been able to do that."
6495667,eng,Tom and Mary apparently didn't do what they were supposed to do.
7172794,eng,I thought that Tom was downstairs.
3498198,eng,Good evening. I'd like a glass of milk.
3232194,eng,Tom wallowed in self-pity after Mary dumped him.
10277423,eng,Organic chemistry is pure memorization.
6343407,eng,Tom wasn't the best student in our class.
308246,eng,How should I answer if she inquires after you?
6048628,eng,Is there any way we can help Tom more?
9199502,eng,There's something stuck in my teeth.
5758033,eng,All things change.
1483005,eng,Tom only listens to B-sides.
7325614,eng,Sami was experimenting with alcohol.
2539441,eng,I'm sorry I got you involved in this.
2892975,eng,Why wouldn't Tom take our offer seriously?
2003748,eng,"Don't go, my dears."
922939,eng,"Due to overfishing, some fish stocks are now at perilously low levels."
3823387,eng,Tom has been telling me about it.
2388117,eng,I never got the chance to thank Tom.
8296986,eng,I wish that I'd done what Tom told me to do.
7173695,eng,I thought that you knew Tom was allergic to peanuts.
1860451,eng,Don't let go of me.
10100243,eng,"If I'd known how hard it was to let go of your hand, I wouldn't have touched it."
3720635,eng,"It happened that, as I was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream."
278932,eng,"Weather permitting, we will go on a picnic tomorrow."
2997090,eng,Did someone pay for this?
5509146,eng,The show starts at midnight.
10023872,eng,We hope that that happens.
6713145,eng,I don't like your car.
6422526,eng,Mary realized she had made a mistake.
3619634,eng,We'll never know who he is.
2474268,eng,This button has come off.
1326779,eng,"Can you accompany me there, please?"
7374855,eng,Mary knows she's going to be arrested.
3575401,eng,"Hey, do you guys want to order a pizza?"
9101808,eng,Yanni invited Skura to Algeria.
5306647,eng,Tom eats chocolate almost every day.
67039,eng,"That is not a horse, but a donkey."
3024345,eng,I flew to Boston last week.
6633657,eng,It won't matter in the long run.
8564097,eng,The road is very curvy.
7398180,eng,She told me that she was certain.
10068603,eng,"The top floor of the town's only high-rise building offers a wonderful view across town, with not a high-rise in sight."
6618692,eng,His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak.
48998,eng,"That picture doesn't seem ugly to me; on the contrary, I think it's rather beautiful."
3821091,eng,I knew there was somebody in the next room.
8942705,eng,Tom won't go there with Mary.
285600,eng,His speech was not altogether bad.
6353815,eng,Tom is probably still here.
7471523,eng,Tom and Mary don't know where they should go.
7258166,eng,The movie isn't as good as the book.
573879,eng,You never turn off the music and the lights before going to bed.
34834,eng,Drinking beer refreshes me.
2540029,eng,Many homeless people live in parks.
6583702,eng,"My liver, my business. Case closed, said Tom."
5491540,eng,I'm good at those things.
6351062,eng,I think Tom can't win.
2742282,eng,Read the kinds of books that you find interesting.
6871046,eng,I would have never thought of that.
2645489,eng,"It's my fault, you know."
10216152,eng,Ziri is gonna miss Rima when she's gone.
6343419,eng,Tom wasn't able to get the motor started.
6229846,eng,Tom said that he's been wanting to visit Boston for a long time.
3093759,eng,We're not here to talk about that.
8028732,eng,"This is just me, showing off for the girls."
6356808,eng,I got back home today.
3916045,eng,I'll give you that.
6221985,eng,I'd like to try to do that.
3594040,eng,That's not what worries me.
9227266,eng,I heard you bought a yacht.
932524,eng,Bring him to me.
7873889,eng,I'm getting married next Monday.
6704114,eng,I can't believe that Tom was able to do this all by himself.
7131014,eng,Tom has made an impressive comeback.
5424313,eng,Tom likes adventures.
7442171,eng,They weren't sure that they liked the plan.
9806983,eng,Yanni doesn't want to marry Skura.
6810577,eng,Sami didn't like that house.
9096838,eng,Tom laid the table for two.
4663282,eng,Tom doesn't need to finish this by tomorrow.
5944714,eng,"Just put it here, please."
9723003,eng,The woman is reading the recipe.
9737988,eng,Yanni gave up cigarettes after the doctor's warning.
1095309,eng,Tom changed jobs.
6731349,eng,Mary can't cook as well as her mother can.
3023780,eng,Tom has been very upset.
6484949,eng,Sami likes to be at home.
7985897,eng,Sami can't get rid of his chlamydia because he isn't working.
6421156,eng,"Mary doesn't want to do that, does she?"
2538459,eng,Tom told Mary what John did for a living.
7803602,eng,You don't have to do it now.
7182319,eng,Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that.
8567297,eng,This towel is so beautiful. It has printed patterns.
7443636,eng,Tom and Mary told me that they were pessimistic.
5592710,eng,"Together, anything is possible."
1764503,eng,She has wine.
8845077,eng,Show me the book that you're reading.
3921261,eng,You should be ashamed of yourselves after the way you treated Tom.
5289818,eng,I often do my homework before dinner.
9173063,eng,Tom was apparently drunk.
2644404,eng,Tom introduced his family.
10069496,eng,Yanni spoke no Berber.
680858,eng,The criminal did evil things as a child.
2213985,eng,It was a big one.
9690244,eng,The land on which the Tuaregs live is extremely poor.
6375396,eng,I know how you love surprises.
5175142,eng,I recommend it.
7186037,eng,I'm sorry that I missed your party.
2706719,eng,What time does the train arrive?
10496839,eng,The motorbike has broken down.
10026587,eng,Yanni has finally come.
10132125,eng,Algeria's labor regulations don't encourage investment.
5632864,eng,Emotional blackmail is an immoral way of getting people to do what you want them to.
2380223,eng,I love the way you think.
8680847,eng,"Back in my day, we had to use a CD burner to burn data to a CD."
8043657,eng,I wonder what would happen if I pushed this button.
6418926,eng,I kept watching Mary to see what she'd do.
5623865,eng,Are you expecting me to help you?
67570,eng,"American politics are interesting to watch, especially during a presidential election."
10123813,eng,Fear is a disease; hope is its only cure.
6274813,eng,Tom and Mary found John.
276893,eng,The man threw a bag across his shoulder.
287347,eng,His comment hit below the belt.
2325988,eng,I feel kind of nauseous.
9891902,eng,"If they're looking for us, I'm sure they'll find us."
7981978,eng,Sami withdrew money from his bank account.
9081202,eng,I need a smaller size.
6313948,eng,A smile is the prettiest thing you can wear.
10508887,eng,"Sir, you need to take your seat."
4663409,eng,Tom told Mary that he was glad to see her.
4013963,eng,Do you have a letter opener?
238058,eng,Have you allowed for any error in your calculation?
807694,eng,The judge found Scopes guilty of breaking the law.
10145985,eng,Tom didn't know shoplifting was illegal.
41576,eng,I'd be crazy to expect such a thing.
2540558,eng,I'll tell you exactly what to say.
6500201,eng,Tom and Mary ate their lunches in the park by themselves.
6781246,eng,Tom is well-known and notorious.
8370641,eng,The heating season has ended.
28374,eng,It feels like I've seen her before.
8363882,eng,He taught me courage.
10287773,eng,Tom was the architect that designed that building.
2249286,eng,It's standard procedure.
10735915,eng,You should've gotten my message.
5360821,eng,Uh-oh! Dark storm clouds are gathering over the lake.
45790,eng,The teacher is strict with his students.
1258234,eng,She can say whatever she wants.
8412669,eng,The facts are plain. No one can deny them.
7861493,eng,Do you think Abdelaziz Bouteflika was a good leader for Algeria?
3309756,eng,Let's stick to the plan.
1027659,eng,"After polishing his shoes, Tom brushed his teeth and combed his hair."
8546568,eng,Giraffes are mysterious animals.
9226864,eng,Unbutton your coat.
3178602,eng,It has to be removed.
10025333,eng,A tick is a hematophagous mite.
10568576,eng,Finally I found the answer to my question.
6661748,eng,I don't need your answer right away.
6245255,eng,I don't think Tom will be in Boston.
7385133,eng,She had her piano tuned.
7171353,eng,I thought that you said you were the first one to do that.
3825389,eng,I want this dictionary.
20326,eng,The weather will soon begin to calm down.
3204370,eng,Why would I tell you where I hide my money?
3730922,eng,Are you saying Tom was one of them?
2549699,eng,It was a hoax.
6431501,eng,Tom said he thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
7377400,eng,"Mary isn't very courageous, is she?"
28589,eng,Bad money drives out good.
7147697,eng,Sami didn't drink juice.
2537552,eng,I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason for this.
7245768,eng,Sami slammed the door open and that woke Layla up.
8543280,eng,I fixed a clock.
3244831,eng,It was fun to celebrate together.
6515022,eng,Tom and Mary said that they weren't retired.
